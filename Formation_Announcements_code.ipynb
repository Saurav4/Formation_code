      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don't expect the joint\n",
      "venture to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP\n",
      "gets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new\n",
      "business outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed\n",
      "agency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model\n",

      "Being a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the\n",
      "other hand, is `highly fragmented'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically\n",
      "in the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic\n",
      "savings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "That AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have\n",
      "entered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won't\n",
      "have lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be\n",
      "\"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is\n",
      "trained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance\n",
      "product per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve.\n",
      "As the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of\n",
      "insurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don't do it, customers will go competitors,\" he\n",

Others seen from left are: Tim Wade, MD, AMP International, S. V. Mony, CEO of AMP\\nSanmar, Penelope Anne Wensley,\\n\\nHigh Commissioner of Australia in India, and N. Sankar, Chairman, the Sanmar group. - Photo: T. A. Hafeez\\n\\nCHENNAI, JAN. 21. The over 150-year-old Australian financial service company, AMP International, will have\\na `significant management influence\\' in the 26:74 life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched\\nhere today.\\n\\nThough it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance\\nCompany, the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant\\n\\nmanagement influence\\' will, according to Tim Wade, Managing Director of AMP International, \"help AMP\\nbring all its skills to bear more quickly, efficiently and effectively.\"\\n\\nNot surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint\\nventure to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP\\ngets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new\\nbusiness outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says.\\n\\nUnlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed\\nagency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model\\noutside its core markets.\\n\\n\"It is important that AMP gets it right here. That is why India is very high on our priority list,\" Mr. Wade says.\\n\\nBeing a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the\\nother hand, is `highly fragmented\\'.\\n\\nThough AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically\\nin the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic\\nsavings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent.\\n\\nThat AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have\\nentered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won\\'t\\nhave lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be\\n\"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is\\ntrained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts.\\n\\nMr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance\\nproduct per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve.\\nAs the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of\\ninsurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don\\'t do it, customers will go competitors,\" he\\nreasons.\\n\\nAccording to S.V. Mony, Chief Executive Officer, the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than\\nothers\". A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before\\nFebruary-end,\" he claims.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment? Striking alliances with\\ncorporates, carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches, moving of qualified advisers to\\ntowns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers. \"We have gone into a\\nrigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand. A brand strategy document is\\nevolved at micro as well macro levels,\" says Mr. Mony. \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building\\npolicy which will align with our business strategy,\" he adds.\\n\\nMr. Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs. 26 crores in the first full year of operation with a\\npolicyholder base of 30,000. He expects the sum assured by the joint venture to be around Rs. 300 crores by\\nthen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneral/also in this issue\\nVF DEAL WILL BOOST PRESENCE IN INDIA\\n\\nRoss Tucker\\n527 words\\n5 September 2006\\nWomen\\'s Wear Daily\\nWWD\\n2\\nEnglish\\nCopyright 2006 Fairchild Publications, Inc.

Those brands were previously handled through a\\nlicensing and distribution agreement with Arvind subsidiary Arvind Fashions.\\n\\n\"Arvind Mills and the management team that built our Lee and Wrangler brand business in India over the last\\ndecade have been great partners,\" Mackey McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a\\nstatement. \"Extending our partnership with this joint venture is a logical evolution of our strong relationship.\"\\n\\nDarshan Mehta has been named ceo of the venture, which will be based in Bangalore and employ 180\\npeople. Mehta will report to Eric Wiseman, VF\\'s president and chief operating officer, who has been named\\nchairman. Previously, Mehta served as president of Arvind Brands.\\n\\nArvind launched Tommy Hilfiger in India through its nine freestanding stores in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai,\\nKolkota, Hyderabad and Chennai. Last month, Arvind introduced the Gant brand in the country. In addition,\\nthe firm has several homegrown brands such as Excalibur, Flying Machine, Ruggers, Bay Island and\\nNewport. In May, the company said it planned to open the Arvind Design Lab, a design center and showroom\\nfor its U.S. customers, in late summer in SoHo in New York.\\n\\nNews of the latest joint venture came just after VF revealed the reorganization of its international\\nmanagement team with an eye toward increasing its overseas business to 30 percent of total revenues over\\nthe next three to five years. Karl Heinz Salzburger was named to the new post of president of Europe, Middle\\nEast, Africa and Asia, and indicated that the Chinese, Indian and Russian markets would be a focus of the\\ncompany\\'s expansion efforts. India\\'s rising middle class and population of more than 1 billion make it\\nparticularly attractive.\\n\\n\"The branded apparel market in India is approximately $4.4 billion and continues to grow as consumers are\\nbecoming increasingly brand- and fashion-conscious,\" Mehta said in a statement.\\n\\nIndia already figures prominently in VF\\'s international business. According to the company, the Lee,\\nWrangler, Nautica, JanSport and Kipling brands currently generate $40 million in wholesale volume in India.\\nThose brands alone are expected to grow more than 25 percent per year. The joint venture also will allow the\\ncompany to more easily introduce new brands into the market.\\n\\n\"Already, we\\'re at $1.6 billion in revenue outside the U.S. As far as apparel companies go, that\\'s pretty big,\"\\nsaid Wiseman last week. \"I look at China and India as important places to build the right brand foundation.\"\\nVF reported $6.5 billion in revenues in 2005 and anticipates revenues growing 6 to 7 percent this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews & Commentary\\nBajaj Auto, Renault, Nissan form low-cost car JV\\n\\nV.

India allows foreign\\nsingle-brand retailers to hold up to 51 percent in local joint ventures, while multiple-brand retailers like\\nWal-Mart are limited to cash-and-carry and franchise deals.\\n\\nBut opening up a fragmented Indian industry dominated by family-run shops has triggered political concerns\\nand protests by small shop owners who fear millions will lose their jobs.\\n\\nIn August, Reliance Industries Ltd , the country\\'s biggest private company, delayed plans for hundreds of\\nsupermarkets in the north and east after India\\'s most-populous state shut 10 stores after protests from small\\ntraders.\\n\\nJain said some family-owned stores have been \"embracing\" cash-and-carry since it will give them more\\n\"buying leverage\" for goods at similar prices paid by bigger players.\\n\\n\"A lot of mom-and-pops see this is a way for them to be able to compete with organized retail,\" he said.\\n\\nVendors ranging from Unilever and Procter & Gamble Co who \"know the game\" to small suppliers that make\\nonly one product are eager to work with the joint venture, he said.\\n\\nHe said the venture was also working with medium-sized and small suppliers with learning what it takes to be\\na Wal-Mart supplier, from using bar codes to hooking up to the Internet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWal-Mart and Bharti have not disclosed how much money they are putting into their venture. Bharti has\\npreviously said its retail arm would spend $2.5 billion by 2015 on multiple-format retail stores across India.\\n\\nJain said Wal-Mart has not provided a figure largely because it does not yet know how much it will need to\\nput into the venture, but he said: \"We will invest whatever it takes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDJ Ashapura Minechem, BHP, 2 Others In Aluminum JV Talks - Exec\\n\\n187 words\\n14 August 2007\\n22:54\\nDow Jones Chinese Financial Wire\\nDJCFWE\\nEnglish\\nCopyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\\nMUMBAI (Dow Jones)--India\\'s Ashapura Minechem Ltd.

Currently, Concor\\nhas a container train operating licence through which it is permitted to move cars within containers. But if it\\nwants to bring in specially designed wagons for car transportation it will have to obtain another SFTO licence\\nunder the Railway Ministry\\'s proposed policy.\\n\\nThe fast-growing car transportation market in India is served primarily by the road sector, which provides\\nend-to-end service and is usually cheaper than railways. Some container train operators such as Concor and\\nAdani Group\\'s container train operating arm do move cars on containers on certain routes. But they have not\\nbeen able to grab any significant share, yet.\\n\\nSFTO POLICY\\n\\nThe Railway Ministry is in the process of finalising the SFTO scheme. SFTOs will be companies that invest in\\nprocurement of rakes and arrange traffic for loading/unloading in Special Freight Trains (SFT), owned by\\nthem after obtaining necessary permission from the Railway Ministry. Under the scheme — as listed in the\\nMinistry\\'s draft policy — the firms wanting to be SFTOs have to obtain a licence for moving a specified\\ncategory of goods. For instance, in this case, the Concor-NYK joint venture will apply for SFTO licence to\\nservice the automobile sector. The licence can be obtained through a two-stage competitive bid — technical\\nand financial. However, the exact contours will clear only after the Ministry finalises the policy.\\n\\nCONCOR\\'s EVALUATION\\n\\n“We are currently moving cars by containers in limited circuits. We have also imported some special\\ncontainers that can carry more cars. But this is also an area where the Railway Ministry is working on a\\nseparate policy. We are looking at that policy. We will see if we want to operate car carriers regularly,” Mr Anil\\nK. Gupta, Managing Director, Concor, told Business Line. He added that Concor will evaluate the SFTO\\nlicence for its joint venture company with NYK.\\n\\nLast year, Concor had set up a 50:50 joint venture company with NYK Line to provide end-to-end car\\ntransportation services to automobile manufacturers, with a focus on rail-based transportation. NYK of Japan\\nis known for its expertise in operating automobile terminals and its extensive fleet of Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off)\\nships. In India, NYK has a memorandum of understanding with Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone\\n(MPSEZ) to set up a world-class dedicated automobile terminal. About three years ago, Concor had tried\\nintroducing specially designed wagons to move cars. But the project did not take off because the haulage\\ncharges decided by the Railways for moving the specially designed wagons were high and rendered the\\nproject financially unviable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcor, NYK in Joint Venture\\n\\nJOC STAFF\\n223 words\\n12 May 2009\\nJournal of Commerce Online\\nJOCO\\nEnglish\\n(c) 2009 Commonwealth Business Media.

The Murugappa Group, a $1.5 billion conglomerate with\\ndiversified interests in agro industries, engineering, finance, insurance and bio-products, currently owns 55\\npercent of CIFCL principally through Tube Investments of India Ltd. (TI).\\n\\nCIFCL operates in 120 locations across India providing primarily vehicle finance as well as finance against\\nshares and property. It also offers asset management, securities broking and distribution of financial products\\nthrough its subsidiaries.\\n\\nThe transaction combines CIFCL\\'s distribution network in auto finance across India, and DBS\\' expertise in\\nfinancial product development, credit assessment and risk management. It involves DBS Bank buying shares\\nfrom TI, making an offer to public shareholders and subscribing to a preferential allotment of shares by CIFCL\\nto DBS Bank.\\n\\nWhen completed, the transaction will result in DBS Bank and the Murugappa Group having equal\\nshareholding of up to 37.5 percent each. Both will have the right to nominate equal number of directors on the\\nBoard. CIFCL will be renamed Cholamandalam DBS Finance Limited. It will be engaged in vehicle finance\\nand other retail financing such as personal loans and home equity.\\n\\nDBS Bank\\'s investment will be up to Rs. 228 crore ($87 million), to be funded by internal resources. All the\\nshares will be purchased at Rs. 150 a share.

The XML technology leader has initiated the\\ndevelopment of solution platforms for mobile computing and content management. The next step is to build\\napplications on top of them, serving general (horizontal) and industry-specific (vertical) needs. SAG India will\\nconcentrate on this area in the initial phase of its operations.\\n\\n\"Speed is a crucial factor in the field of standard applications. The professional experience of iGate GS will\\naccelerate the process of going to market for our new solutions,\" explains Dr. Peter Mossack, Software AG\\'s\\nCTO and member of the board, who will be the chairman of Software AG India.\\n\\nSAG India\\'s second business line will be project services. The company will provide offshore and onsite\\nservice engineers and programmers to complement Software AG\\'s local teams worldwide, with initial focus on\\nEurope and the USA. This will allow for a more competitive cost base in customer projects. Furthermore,\\nespecially in the startup phase SAG India can draw on a large pool of iGATE GS\\'s skilled IT labor in India,\\nwhich will guarantee a fast ramp-up of the new company. This will immediately provide Software AG\\'s local\\nteams with a highly flexible and broadly-experienced skill resource pool, and with the ability to acquire larger\\nprojects than before.\\n\\nApplication management and maintenance services will be SAG India\\'s third business line. Partly in order to\\ncut costs and partly because of lack of skills, corporations and government agencies are turning to\\noutsourcing of the operational support for their business applications. Software AG has already made first\\nsteps into this business segment, and expects to build market share with the help of its new partner.\\n\\nCommenting on the joint venture, Gerhard Watzinger, Chief Executive Officer of iGate GS, who was\\ninstrumental in structuring the arrangement said, \"We see an extremely robust growth opportunity in the\\nburgeoning German market and the joint venture with Software AG further reinforces our established position\\nin this region. However, the objective of this JV agreement goes beyond Germany, and is to provide\\nworld-class, cost-effective IT services to customers globally and thereby make a substantial contribution to\\ntheir businesses. We are confident of the synergistic strengths both partners bring to the table and believe\\nthat the venture provides a classic \\'win-win\\' proposition.\"\\n\\nThe joint venture will be established as a private limited company. Software AG will hold 51%, iGATE GS\\n49% of the equity (300,000 Euro). Each of the parent companies will be represented on the Board by two\\ndirectors. Operations will be managed by General Manager Rajan Bhatnagar.\\n\\nSoftware AG took the decision after carefully analyzing the offshore markets. The target of lowering costs for\\nsoftware engineering in solutions development and projects was the trigger to look for offshore resources.\\nHowever, the offshore partner also had to meet up to Software AG\\'s high standard of quality, and add skills\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\\n\\nthat complement the leading technology know-how in the field of standard applications and outsourcing. Last\\nbut not least, the joint venture partners should be of equal size to provide a similar level of management\\nattention.\\n\\niGate GS and Software AG are a perfect match. Both expect to draw substantial synergies from the\\npartnership, which is laid out for significant further growth, a long business relationship and expansion into\\nother offshore markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness\\nFarallon pays Rs 88cr for 33% stake in Indiabulls arm\\n\\n482 words\\n3 January 2005\\nThe Times of India\\nTOI\\nEnglish\\n(c) 2005 The Times of India Group\\nNEW DELHI: San Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C. has invested Rs 88 crore for 33.3%\\nstake in Indiabulls Credit Services Ltd, a majority-owned subsidiary of Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd.\\nFarallon Capital, a registered investment adviser with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, is a\\nmulti-strategy investment fund with over $12 billion in assets under management.\\n\\nIndiabulls Credit Services is focused on the booming consumer finance market in India and will engage in\\noffering personal loans to the vast middle markets under its branding, Easy Money.

But a person involved in the deal said Invesco has\\nagreed to pay about $90 million for the stake.\\n\\nReligare Asset Management managed $2.6 billion in assets as of late August.\\n\\nInvesco\\'s entry to India comes just a few months after U.S. mutual-fund firm Fidelity Investments quit its\\nIndian mutual-fund business, which was being run by its affiliate Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Fidelity\\'s fund\\nunit in India notched losses every year since it opened in 2004. In March, the unit was sold to L&T Finance\\nLtd., part of India\\'s Larsen & Toubro Group.\\n\\nIndia\\'s fund industry, which had been growing rapidly until a few years ago, has lately struggled to attract\\ninvestors. Returns from stock investments haven\\'t kept pace with the high returns provided by gold and real\\nestate, which individual investors now prefer.\\n\\nRegulatory changes, including one that limited the amount of commission fund companies could pay\\nsalespeople, also hurt the sales of mutual funds.\\n\\nInvestors have pulled money out of Indian stock mutual funds for seven out of eight months through August to\\nthe tune of $1.2 billion, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.\\n\\nInvesco, however, seems unfazed by the slowdown in India\\'s fund industry.\\n\\n\"We think there is a huge potential in India\\'s asset management industry,\" said Andrew Lo, chief executive of\\nInvesco\\'s Asia Pacific unit. Given India\\'s large population and the fact that only a small portion of the people\\ninvest in mutual funds, there is a lot of scope for growth, said Mr. Lo.\\n\\n\"At some stage, [stock investors] will come back,\" said Mr. Lo. This is because India \"has a high savings rate,\\na high inflation and there is a need for people to invest,\" he added. Mr. Lo noted that that despite the tough\\nconditions, Religare had managed to increase its assets and broken even.\\n\\nSome other foreign money managers also seem to have an optimistic view. Earlier this year, U.K.-based\\nprivate-banking group Schroders PLC bought a 25% stake in the asset-management arm of India\\'s Axis Bank\\nLtd.\\n\\nAnalysts say that while foreign investment is welcome in India\\'s fund industry, companies will need to bring\\ninnovative products to attract investors. These could include introducing funds that provide exposure to global\\ninvestments, said Rajesh Krishnamoorthy, managing director of Mumbai-based fund distributor iFAST\\nFinancial India. He said there is growing interest among some Indian investors to buy such funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe joint venture, Religare Invesco Asset Management Co. will be headed by Saurabh Nanavati, chief\\nexecutive of Religare Asset Management.

Out of\\nthis, 50% of the market is considered to be Institutional and the balance is prescription based. The multi-drug\\nresistant TB (MDR-TB), which is caused by bacteria resistant to Rifampicin and/or INH or both drugs, is\\nemerging as a major problem. While the cost of treatment of normal TB with first line drugs is estimated at\\nUSD 40-100 per patient, the MDR-TB treatment cost is substantially higher. The cost of treatment is about\\nUSD 800 per patient under WHO managed program as per Green Light Committee.

The over 150-year-old Australian financial service company, AMP International, will have\\na `significant management influence\\' in the 26:74 life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched\\nhere today.\\n\\nThough it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance\\nCompany, the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant\\n\\nmanagement influence\\' will, according to Tim Wade, Managing Director of AMP International, \"help AMP\\nbring all its skills to bear more quickly, efficiently and effectively.\"\\n\\nNot surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint\\nventure to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP\\ngets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new\\nbusiness outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says.\\n\\nUnlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed\\nagency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model\\noutside its core markets.\\n\\n\"It is important that AMP gets it right here. That is why India is very high on our priority list,\" Mr. Wade says.\\n\\nBeing a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the\\nother hand, is `highly fragmented\\'.\\n\\nThough AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically\\nin the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic\\nsavings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent.\\n\\nThat AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have\\nentered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won\\'t\\nhave lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be\\n\"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is\\ntrained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts.\\n\\nMr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance\\nproduct per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve.\\nAs the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of\\ninsurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don\\'t do it, customers will go competitors,\" he\\nreasons.\\n\\nAccording to S.V. Mony, Chief Executive Officer, the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than\\nothers\". A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before\\nFebruary-end,\" he claims.\\n\\n\\nHow could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment? Striking alliances with\\ncorporates, carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches, moving of qualified advisers to\\ntowns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers. \"We have gone into a\\nrigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand. A brand strategy document is\\nevolved at micro as well macro levels,\" says Mr. Mony. \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building\\npolicy which will align with our business strategy,\" he adds.\\n\\nMr. Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs. 26 crores in the first full year of operation with a\\npolicyholder base of 30,000.

Oberoi, Chairman, EIH Ltd, at a\\npress conference in Mumbai on Thursday. - Paul Noronha\\n\\nMumbai, Sept. 4\\n\\nHILTON, among the best-known hotel brands globally, will now have a sizeable presence in India, courtesy a\\nstrategic co-branding alliance with EIH Ltd, which owns the Oberoi and Trident hotel chains.\\n\\nAccordingly, nine properties - existing Trident hotels at Agra, Kochi, Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Jaipur, Udaipur\\nand proposed hotels at Gurgaon and North Mumbai - will be re-branded, Trident Hilton.\\n\\nJoining them, is the city\\'s landmark Oberoi Towers, which will be rechristened Hilton Towers.\\n\\nThe franchisee agreement, wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton, gives the\\nforeign hotel major access to 1,900 rooms in the domestic market. More Trident properties may join the\\nalliance, provided they meet required specifications.\\n\\nThe alliance does not cover the Oberoi brand, inclusion of the Oberoi Towers to the fold being ascribed to\\nexisting plans for making it a Trident hotel.\\n\\nThe property is not perceived to be of the same luxury levels as the new Oberoi next door. Mr S.S. Mukherji,\\nManaging Director, EIH, said, Trident Hilton hotels would strive to be the best in its segment while the Oberoi\\nbrand would remain higher up in the heirarchy.\\n\\nThe value distinction between the two brands will thus continue, notwithstanding the Hilton alliance.\\n\\nAlso, Trident will likely stay a domestic brand while EIH\\'s expansion overseas will be with the Oberoi brand.\\n\\nStrategic alliance for the Oberoi brand is currently not being considered, Mr Mukherji said.\\n\\nAt a press briefing attended by Mr P.R.S. Oberoi, Chairman & CEO, EIH, company officials said the move is\\nnot a prelude to equity participation by Hilton at EIH. But on likely spin-off for Trident, Mr Mukherji said, that\\nwas for the future to decide.\\n\\nHilton usually operates owned properties, franchisee agreements reserved for trusted partners. The alliance\\nbetween EIH and Hilton International (subsidiary of Hilton Group plc and Hilton Hotels Corporation) is for an\\ninitial 15 years, but Mr Oberoi said, the two were \"looking forward to a much longer relationship.\" Today\\'s\\nagreement does not prevent EIH or Hilton from continuing their growth here through owned properties. \"It is\\npossible that we will invest, but we will be wiser investors,\" Mr David Michels, Group Chief Executive, Hilton\\nGroup, said.\\n\\nHe maintained, the timing of the alliance is correct for the simple reason that hoteliering post-9/11 has been\\ndifficult and it is a business that \"always comes back.\"\\n\\nIt will take a year or two for the alliance to show result, but as business improves the Trident-Hilton alliance is\\nexpected to fetch properties here higher occupancy levels and better match between rack rates (published\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntariff) and actual rates. Key ingredients would be Hilton\\'s reservation system and clientele abroad, including\\nits loyalty programme that boasts of eight million regular customers.\\n\\nMr Michels said, the foreign major is also interested in growing outbound travel from India, prospective\\nbusiness for Hilton properties elsewhere in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nHIMALYA INTERNATIONAL GOES FOR JV WITH J.R.SIMPLOT (to market products of Himalaya\\nInternational in India and South-East Asian markets)\\n\\nPROCESSED FOOD INDUSTRY.

The joint venture company will be located in\\nPune in the Region of Mumbai (Bombay). Operations are planned to start in October 2003 with an initial\\nworkforce of about 50. The number will be increased as business develops.\\n\\nThe German/Indian joint venture is in line with Software AG\\'s strategy to develop and market new solutions in\\naddition to their current technology product portfolio. The XML technology leader has initiated the\\ndevelopment of solution platforms for mobile computing and content management. The next step is to build\\napplications on top of them, serving general (horizontal) and industry-specific (vertical) needs. SAG India will\\nconcentrate on this area in the initial phase of its operations.\\n\\n\"Speed is a crucial factor in the field of standard applications. The professional experience of iGate GS will\\naccelerate the process of going to market for our new solutions,\" explains Dr. Peter Mossack, Software AG\\'s\\nCTO and member of the board, who will be the chairman of Software AG India.\\n\\nSAG India\\'s second business line will be project services. The company will provide offshore and onsite\\nservice engineers and programmers to complement Software AG\\'s local teams worldwide, with initial focus on\\nEurope and the USA. This will allow for a more competitive cost base in customer projects. Furthermore,\\nespecially in the startup phase SAG India can draw on a large pool of iGATE GS\\'s skilled IT labor in India,\\nwhich will guarantee a fast ramp-up of the new company. This will immediately provide Software AG\\'s local\\nteams with a highly flexible and broadly-experienced skill resource pool, and with the ability to acquire larger\\nprojects than before.\\n\\nApplication management and maintenance services will be SAG India\\'s third business line. Partly in order to\\ncut costs and partly because of lack of skills, corporations and government agencies are turning to\\noutsourcing of the operational support for their business applications. Software AG has already made first\\nsteps into this business segment, and expects to build market share with the help of its new partner.\\n\\nCommenting on the joint venture, Gerhard Watzinger, Chief Executive Officer of iGate GS, who was\\ninstrumental in structuring the arrangement said, \"We see an extremely robust growth opportunity in the\\nburgeoning German market and the joint venture with Software AG further reinforces our established position\\nin this region. However, the objective of this JV agreement goes beyond Germany, and is to provide\\nworld-class, cost-effective IT services to customers globally and thereby make a substantial contribution to\\ntheir businesses.

Software AG will hold 51%, iGATE GS\\n49% of the equity (300,000 Euro). Each of the parent companies will be represented on the Board by two\\ndirectors. Operations will be managed by General Manager Rajan Bhatnagar.\\n\\nSoftware AG took the decision after carefully analyzing the offshore markets. The target of lowering costs for\\nsoftware engineering in solutions development and projects was the trigger to look for offshore resources.\\nHowever, the offshore partner also had to meet up to Software AG\\'s high standard of quality, and add skills\\n\\n\\n\\nthat complement the leading technology know-how in the field of standard applications and outsourcing. Last\\nbut not least, the joint venture partners should be of equal size to provide a similar level of management\\nattention.\\n\\niGate GS and Software AG are a perfect match.

But a person involved in the deal said Invesco has\\nagreed to pay about $90 million for the stake.\\n\\nReligare Asset Management managed $2.6 billion in assets as of late August.\\n\\nInvesco\\'s entry to India comes just a few months after U.S. mutual-fund firm Fidelity Investments quit its\\nIndian mutual-fund business, which was being run by its affiliate Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Fidelity\\'s fund\\nunit in India notched losses every year since it opened in 2004. In March, the unit was sold to L&T Finance\\nLtd., part of India\\'s Larsen & Toubro Group.\\n\\nIndia\\'s fund industry, which had been growing rapidly until a few years ago, has lately struggled to attract\\ninvestors. Returns from stock investments haven\\'t kept pace with the high returns provided by gold and real\\nestate, which individual investors now prefer.\\n\\nRegulatory changes, including one that limited the amount of commission fund companies could pay\\nsalespeople, also hurt the sales of mutual funds.\\n\\nInvestors have pulled money out of Indian stock mutual funds for seven out of eight months through August to\\nthe tune of $1.2 billion, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.\\n\\nInvesco, however, seems unfazed by the slowdown in India\\'s fund industry.\\n\\n\"We think there is a huge potential in India\\'s asset management industry,\" said Andrew Lo, chief executive of\\nInvesco\\'s Asia Pacific unit. Given India\\'s large population and the fact that only a small portion of the people\\ninvest in mutual funds, there is a lot of scope for growth, said Mr. Lo.\\n\\n\"At some stage, [stock investors] will come back,\" said Mr. Lo. This is because India \"has a high savings rate,\\na high inflation and there is a need for people to invest,\" he added. Mr. Lo noted that that despite the tough\\nconditions, Religare had managed to increase its assets and broken even.\\n\\nSome other foreign money managers also seem to have an optimistic view. Earlier this year, U.K.-based\\nprivate-banking group Schroders PLC bought a 25% stake in the asset-management arm of India\\'s Axis Bank\\nLtd.\\n\\nAnalysts say that while foreign investment is welcome in India\\'s fund industry, companies will need to bring\\ninnovative products to attract investors. These could include introducing funds that provide exposure to global\\ninvestments, said Rajesh Krishnamoorthy, managing director of Mumbai-based fund distributor iFAST\\nFinancial India.

Both parties believe that there would be\\nsynergies derived from the company\\'s traditional strengths and Aspen\\'s experience in the anti-retroviral\\nbusiness and Africa presence. There is a global trend of bundling the treatments of HIV, TB & malaria.\\n\\nAs per current statistics, 8.6 million fresh TB cases get diagnosed every year and it is believed that only 70%\\nof the infected are diagnosed and a lesser percentage actually treated. Estimates by a study group\\nconstituted by WHO in 2001 puts the market size at USD 550-600 million for the first line TB products. Out of\\nthis, 50% of the market is considered to be Institutional and the balance is prescription based. The multi-drug\\nresistant TB (MDR-TB), which is caused by bacteria resistant to Rifampicin and/or INH or both drugs, is\\nemerging as a major problem. While the cost of treatment of normal TB with first line drugs is estimated at\\nUSD 40-100 per patient, the MDR-TB treatment cost is substantially higher. The cost of treatment is about\\nUSD 800 per patient under WHO managed program as per Green Light Committee. The MDR-TB market is\\nexpected to grow exponentially over the next 4-5 years.\\n\\nThe JV will also investigate opportunities to enter the malaria market. The total malarial market is estimated\\nat approx. USD 500 million, of which 85% is concentrated in Africa.\\n\\nDr. D.B. Gupta, Chairman, of the company said, \"We believe that this is a very important step in providing\\ncomprehensive therapeutic care in the areas of conventional TB, MDR-TB and malaria, which are pandemic\\nin nature and a concerted effort is required to provide treatment to the infected.

Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, which are setting up a joint venture (JV) to\\nmake light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in India, will together invest $500 million (Rs1,970 crore) in the\\nproject.\\n\\nThis is the second venture that Nissan has signed in India. It is already setting up a manufacturing facility with\\nMahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in Chennai along with partner Renault SA.\\n\\nNissan and Renault teamed up in 1999, and the latter holds a 44.3% stake in Nissan, while the former owns\\n15% in Renault. Separately, Renault makes the Logan car in India with M&M and plans to make inexpensive,\\nsmall cars with Bajaj Auto Co.\\n\\n“There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and chief\\nexecutive officer of Nissan, who is also the CEO of Renault.\\n\\nThe Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor\\nCo.’s Ace, which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment. The JV will make trucks in the range of\\n2.5-8 tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). At the lower end of the lower range, a GVW of 2.5 would mean a\\npayload (goods carrying) capacity of 1.25 tonnes. This category has gained in popularity after a court ruling\\nbanned overloading of trucks, forcing goods carriers to ship goods to a central warehouse (on large or heavy\\ntrucks) for redistribution to multiple locations using smaller trucks. Previously, overloaded trucks would serve\\nseveral locations, offloading goods as they went along.\\n\\nNissan and Ashok Leyland’s light truck project will operate through three companies. The first, in which Ashok\\nLeyland will hold a 51% stake, will manufacture the trucks and will be responsible for sales. The second,\\nwhere Nissan will hold a 51% stake, will manufacture engines for the trucks; and the third, where both Ashok\\nLeyland and Nissan will hold equal stakes, will be a technology development company that will design new\\nproducts and engines.\\n\\n“This move will transform ALL ( Ashok Leyland) from a peripheral LCV player to a significant market\\nparticipant,” said Amit Kosat and Rohan A. Korde, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a report\\nreleased after the initial announcement was made. Leyland “will be able to boast a complete portfolio of CVs\\n(commercial vehicles) once the JVs with Nissan get operationalized”, their report added.\\n\\nThe manufacturing company will make products under two brand names, Ashok Leyland and Nissan, and\\nthere would be “significant price difference” between the two brands, said R. Seshasayee, managing director\\nof Ashok Leyland. The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan\\none. Though there will be two different brand names, Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding\\nbetween Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the returns to both firms would be same.\\n\\nThe Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher\\nlending rates; however, sales have grown in the sub-3.5 tonne GVW segment and the more than 16.2-tonne\\nGVW one.\\n\\nFrom around 10% market share by volume in the truck segment in 2001-02, the sub-3.5 tonne segment now\\naccounts for 30% of the market. Nissan sold close of half million LCVs in 2006.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two proposed manufacturing firms have not yet identified the location for the project to manufacture\\ntrucks and engines, but has shortlisted three states—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand—as\\npossible locations for the plants. The technology development firm will be based in Chennai.\\n\\nThe truck manufacturing company will initially have a capacity of 0.1 million units per annum, which will be\\ndoubled by 2014; production starts in 2010. The engine manufacturing company will also supply to Nissan’s\\nproduction plants outside India, apart from supplying to the LCV project in India, Seshasayee said.\\n\\nAmong the first vehicles being planned for launch is Nissan’s new Atlas F24 light duty truck, which has a\\nGVW of less than five tonnes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPanacea ties up with Britain\\'s Chiron for new vaccines\\n\\n253 words\\n24 November 2004\\nHindustan Times\\nHNTM\\nEnglish\\n(c) 2004 The Hindustan Times Ltd\\nIndo-Asian News Service\\n\\nMumbai, Nov 24 -- Panacea Biotec, one of India\\'s leading biotechnology companies, Wednesday entered into\\nan agreement with Britain\\'s Chiron Vaccines to launch new vaccines in the local market.\\n\\nAs part of the agreement, a new joint venture, Chiron Panacea Vaccines, has been floated with equal\\nparticipation of both the companies, said Rajesh Jain, joint managing director of Panacea Biotec.\\n\\nChiron Panacea Vaccines will bridge the technology gap to produce innovative fully liquid paediatric\\ncombination vaccines, he told a press conference here, adding the alliance will provide India with a key\\ncompetitive advantage.\\n\\n\"We are delighted that Panacea Biotec is taking a world leading role by forming this joint venture with Chiron\\nVaccines to market highly advanced technology driven vaccines,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The vaccine world is undergoing a radical rethink about how vaccines might be stored and administered.

These are English general entertainment channel Big CBS Prime, youth entertainment channel\\nBig CBS Spark and women-oriented channel Big CBS Love. The channels target upper socio-economic class\\nand will compete with other English entertainment channels such as Zee CafÃ©, Star World and AXN.\\nCurrently, the English entertainment genre captures about 0.14% of the total television viewership.\\n\\nThe channels will be on digital and analog and will be available in Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,\\nMaldives and Pakistan. The company will be leveraging its direct-to-home (DTH) platform Big TV and recently\\nacquired Reliance Digicable to distribute the channels.\\n\\nReliance ADAG had announced the broadcast plans nearly three years ago. RBNL CEO Tarun Katial said,\\n\"We restructured the company and completed the exercise nearly 6 months ago.

Pioneer and\\nNewpek LLC, Pioneer\\'s current partner in the Eagle Ford, will simultaneously convey 45% of their respective\\ninterests in the Eagle Ford to Reliance. Newpek, a wholly owned subsidiary of ALFA, S.A.B. de C.V.,\\ncurrently owns an approximate 16% non-operated interest in Pioneer\\'s core Eagle Ford Shale acreage.\\nFollowing the transactions, Pioneer, Reliance and Newpek will own 46%, 45% and 9% of the joint venture\\ninterests, respectively. The joint venture will have an approximate net working interest of 91% in 289,000\\ngross acres implying 263,000 net acres.\\n\\nReliance will pay $1.315 billion for its implied share of 118,000 net acres. This upstream transaction\\nconsideration will include combined upfront cash payments of $263 million and deferred payments of $1.052\\nbillion associated with a carry arrangement for 75% of Pioneer\\'s and Newpek\\'s capital costs over an\\nanticipated four years. The joint venture\\'s leasehold, which is largely undeveloped, is located in the core area\\nof the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. Low operating costs, significant liquids content (70% of the acreage\\nlies within the condensate window) and excellent access to services in the region combine to make the Eagle\\nFord one of the most economically attractive unconventional resource plays in North America.\\n\\nPioneer believes the acreage will support the drilling of over 1,750 wells with a net resource potential to the\\njoint venture of approximately 10 tcfe (4.5 tcfe net to RIL). The joint venture plans to increase the current\\ndrilling program to approximately 140 wells per year within three years. Also included in the transaction is\\ncurrent production of 28 mmcfe/d (11 mmcfe/d net to Reliance) from five currently active horizontal wells.\\n\\nWhile Pioneer will serve as the development operator for the upstream joint venture, Reliance is expected to\\nbegin acting as development operator in certain areas in the coming years as part of the joint venture.\\n\\nAdditionally, Reliance and Pioneer have executed definitive agreements to form a midstream joint venture\\nthat will service the gathering needs of the upstream joint venture. Reliance\\'s subsidiary, Reliance Eagleford\\nMidstream LLC, will pay $46 million to acquire a 49.9% membership interest in the joint venture. Pioneer and\\nReliance will have equal governing rights in the joint venture and Pioneer will serve as operator.\\n\\nUnder the framework of the joint venture, Pioneer will continue acquiring leasehold in the Eagle Ford Shale\\nand Reliance will have the option to acquire a 45% share in all newly acquired acres.\\n\\nCommenting on the joint venture, Mr. PMS Prasad, Executive Director, Reliance Industries said, \"Reliance is\\nvery pleased to establish a long-term partnership with Pioneer in the Eagle Ford shale.

Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, which are setting up a joint venture (JV) to\\nmake light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in India, will together invest $500 million (Rs1,970 crore) in the\\nproject.\\n\\nThis is the second venture that Nissan has signed in India. It is already setting up a manufacturing facility with\\nMahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in Chennai along with partner Renault SA.\\n\\nNissan and Renault teamed up in 1999, and the latter holds a 44.3% stake in Nissan, while the former owns\\n15% in Renault. Separately, Renault makes the Logan car in India with M&M and plans to make inexpensive,\\nsmall cars with Bajaj Auto Co.\\n\\n“There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and chief\\nexecutive officer of Nissan, who is also the CEO of Renault.\\n\\nThe Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor\\nCo.’s Ace, which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment. The JV will make trucks in the range of\\n2.5-8 tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). At the lower end of the lower range, a GVW of 2.5 would mean a\\npayload (goods carrying) capacity of 1.25 tonnes. This category has gained in popularity after a court ruling\\nbanned overloading of trucks, forcing goods carriers to ship goods to a central warehouse (on large or heavy\\ntrucks) for redistribution to multiple locations using smaller trucks. Previously, overloaded trucks would serve\\nseveral locations, offloading goods as they went along.\\n\\nNissan and Ashok Leyland’s light truck project will operate through three companies. The first, in which Ashok\\nLeyland will hold a 51% stake, will manufacture the trucks and will be responsible for sales. The second,\\nwhere Nissan will hold a 51% stake, will manufacture engines for the trucks; and the third, where both Ashok\\nLeyland and Nissan will hold equal stakes, will be a technology development company that will design new\\nproducts and engines.\\n\\n“This move will transform ALL ( Ashok Leyland) from a peripheral LCV player to a significant market\\nparticipant,” said Amit Kosat and Rohan A. Korde, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a report\\nreleased after the initial announcement was made. Leyland “will be able to boast a complete portfolio of CVs\\n(commercial vehicles) once the JVs with Nissan get operationalized”, their report added.\\n\\nThe manufacturing company will make products under two brand names, Ashok Leyland and Nissan, and\\nthere would be “significant price difference” between the two brands, said R. Seshasayee, managing director\\nof Ashok Leyland. The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan\\none. Though there will be two different brand names, Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding\\nbetween Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the returns to both firms would be same.\\n\\nThe Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher\\nlending rates; however, sales have grown in the sub-3.5 tonne GVW segment and the more than 16.2-tonne\\nGVW one.\\n\\nFrom around 10% market share by volume in the truck segment in 2001-02, the sub-3.5 tonne segment now\\naccounts for 30% of the market. Nissan sold close of half million LCVs in 2006.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 2 of 2 © 2020 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.\\n\\nThe two proposed manufacturing firms have not yet identified the location for the project to manufacture\\ntrucks and engines, but has shortlisted three states—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand—as\\npossible locations for the plants. The technology development firm will be based in Chennai.\\n\\nThe truck manufacturing company will initially have a capacity of 0.1 million units per annum, which will be\\ndoubled by 2014; production starts in 2010. The engine manufacturing company will also supply to Nissan’s\\nproduction plants outside India, apart from supplying to the LCV project in India, Seshasayee said.\\n\\nAmong the first vehicles being planned for launch is Nissan’s new Atlas F24 light duty truck, which has a\\nGVW of less than \\n\\nPanacea ties up with Britain\\'s Chiron for new vaccines\\n\\n253 words\\n24 November 2004\\nHindustan Times\\nHNTM\\nEnglish\\n(c) 2004 The Hindustan Times Ltd\\nIndo-Asian News Service\\n\\nMumbai, Nov 24 -- Panacea Biotec, one of India\\'s leading biotechnology companies, Wednesday entered into\\nan agreement with Britain\\'s Chiron Vaccines to launch new vaccines in the local market.\\n\\nAs part of the agreement, a new joint venture, Chiron Panacea Vaccines, has been floated with equal\\nparticipation of both the companies, said Rajesh Jain, joint managing director of Panacea Biotec.\\n\\nChiron Panacea Vaccines will bridge the technology gap to produce innovative fully liquid paediatric\\ncombination vaccines, he told a press conference here, adding the alliance will provide India with a key\\ncompetitive advantage.\\n\\n\"We are delighted that Panacea Biotec is taking a world leading role by forming this joint venture with Chiron\\nVaccines to market highly advanced technology driven vaccines,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The vaccine world is undergoing a radical rethink about how vaccines might be stored and administered.

Ltd.\\nReliance Broadcast Network (RBNL), the Rs 350-crore media arm of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group\\n(ADAG), has unveiled its broadcast plans in association with CBS Studios International, part of the US-based\\nCBS Corporation.\\n\\nUnder the 50:50 JV, christened Big CBS Networks, three English entertainment TV channels will be launched\\nin October. These are English general entertainment channel Big CBS Prime, youth entertainment channel\\nBig CBS Spark and women-oriented channel Big CBS Love. The channels target upper socio-economic class\\nand will compete with other English entertainment channels such as Zee CafÃ©, Star World and AXN.\\nCurrently, the English entertainment genre captures about 0.14% of the total television viewership.\\n\\nThe channels will be on digital and analog and will be available in Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,\\nMaldives and Pakistan. The company will be leveraging its direct-to-home (DTH) platform Big TV and recently\\nacquired Reliance Digicable to distribute the channels.\\n\\nReliance ADAG had announced the broadcast plans nearly three years ago. RBNL CEO Tarun Katial said,\\n\"We restructured the company and completed the exercise nearly 6 months ago. This gave us the opportunity\\nto expand and build media verticals, which now also includes broadcast.\"\\n\\nCBS Studios International president Armando Nunez said, \"The size of the young audiences in India and\\ndigitisation creates the right environment. But we couldn\\'t enter this complex market alone. RBNL\\'s\\nimpressive combination of media assets makes it the right partner for us.\"\\n\\n\"We will fill the channel pricing with the government soon, \" he added. The channels are expected to start\\nselling its advertising inventory in the coming months. It has short listed two ad agencies and will rollout the\\nmarketing initiative soon.\\n\\nMedia planners are upbeat about the new launch. They feel while the other genres on the Indian television\\nspace are highly cluttered, there is good opportunity in the English entertainment space. Lodestar Universal\\nCEO Shashi Sinha said, \"The issue of distribution will always be there but as the number of DTH homes\\nincreases, there is a good opportunity. DTH demands first class content and if these channels are able to\\ndeliver that, then the growth opportunity is tremendous. Also, by looking at the roll out model, it seems like a\\nlong-haul game. They will target limited users. To me, it\\'s a sound model.

Pioneer and\\nNewpek LLC, Pioneer\\'s current partner in the Eagle Ford, will simultaneously convey 45% of their respective\\ninterests in the Eagle Ford to Reliance. Newpek, a wholly owned subsidiary of ALFA, S.A.B. de C.V.,\\ncurrently owns an approximate 16% non-operated interest in Pioneer\\'s core Eagle Ford Shale acreage.\\nFollowing the transactions, Pioneer, Reliance and Newpek will own 46%, 45% and 9% of the joint venture\\ninterests, respectively. The joint venture will have an approximate net working interest of 91% in 289,000\\ngross acres implying 263,000 net acres.\\n\\nReliance will pay $1.315 billion for its implied share of 118,000 net acres. This upstream transaction\\nconsideration will include combined upfront cash payments of $263 million and deferred payments of $1.052\\nbillion associated with a carry arrangement for 75% of Pioneer\\'s and Newpek\\'s capital costs over an\\nanticipated four years. The joint venture\\'s leasehold, which is largely undeveloped, is located in the core area\\nof the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. Low operating costs, significant liquids content (70% of the acreage\\nlies within the condensate window) and excellent access to services in the region combine to make the Eagle\\nFord one of the most economically attractive unconventional resource plays in North America.\\n\\nPioneer believes the acreage will support the drilling of over 1,750 wells with a net resource potential to the\\njoint venture of approximately 10 tcfe (4.5 tcfe net to RIL). The joint venture plans to increase the current\\ndrilling program to approximately 140 wells per year within three years. Also included in the transaction is\\ncurrent production of 28 mmcfe/d (11 mmcfe/d net to Reliance) from five currently active horizontal wells.\\n\\nWhile Pioneer will serve as the development operator for the upstream joint venture, Reliance is expected to\\nbegin acting as development operator in certain areas in the coming years as part of the joint venture.\\n\\nAdditionally, Reliance and Pioneer have executed definitive agreements to form a midstream joint venture\\nthat will service the gathering needs of the upstream joint venture. Reliance\\'s subsidiary, Reliance Eagleford\\nMidstream LLC, will pay $46 million to acquire a 49.9% membership interest in the joint venture. Pioneer and\\nReliance will have equal governing rights in the joint venture and Pioneer will serve as operator.\\n\\nUnder the framework of the joint venture, Pioneer will continue acquiring leasehold in the Eagle Ford Shale\\nand Reliance will have the option to acquire a 45% share in all newly acquired acres.\\n\\nCommenting on the joint venture, Mr. PMS Prasad, Executive Director, Reliance Industries said, \"Reliance is\\nvery pleased to establish a long-term partnership with Pioneer in the Eagle Ford shale. This transaction\\nrepresents another significant milestone in Reliance\\'s efforts to grow its North American shale gas\\noperations.\" Barclays Capital Inc. and UBS Securities LLC acted as financial advisors to Reliance.

The company is likely to roll out its GSM services across India by the end of this year, according\\nto Managing Director Anil Sardana.\\n\\nOutlook and Implications\\n\\nExpansion Into GSM: In October 2007, the Indian government allowed companies such as Reliance\\nCommunications and Tata Teleservices—a Tata Group company—to offer mobile services using GSM\\ntechnology in addition to their existing CDMA-based mobile services. Reliance, the country’s largest CDMA\\noperator, launched a nationwide GSM service by the end of last year (see India: 31 December 2008: ). Both\\nTata and Reliance are betting on their new services to create fresh growth momentum as GSM-based mobile\\nservices have been more popular among Indian mobile users. About three quarters of the country\\'s mobile\\nusers are now on the GSM platform.Strategic Alliance with DoCoMo: The tie-up with Japanese mobile giant\\nDoCoMo will also help Tata Teleservices enhance its position in the highly competitive Indian market. Apart\\nfrom much-needed capital, DoCoMo is also participating proactively in Tata Teleservices\\' management by\\nproviding human resources and technical assistance to help realise improved network quality and the\\nintroduction of leading-edge, value-added services (see Japan: 13 November 2008: ).Strategies for GSM\\nOfferings: Tata Teleservices has drawn up a capital-expenditure plan of US$2 billion for the current fiscal\\nyear ending 31 March 2010, with a large proportion of the investment to be spent on rolling out its nationwide\\nGSM service. The company plans to enter the GSM segment by primarily targeting the mid and high end of\\nthe market. The company has said earlier that it does not intend to play the pricing game by offering low\\ntariffs to woo customers but plans to leverage its tie-up with NTT DoCoMo to offer rich value-added services\\nwhich do not exist in India at present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRPT-UPDATE 3-Fiat, Tata form JV to build cars in India\\n\\n586 words\\n26 July 2006\\n08:09\\nReuters News\\nLBA\\nEnglish\\n(c) 2006 Reuters Limited\\n(Repeats story issued late on Tuesday) (Recasts with joint venture, adds analyst comment, share price,\\nbackground)\\n\\nBy Rina Chandran\\n\\nMUMBAI, July 25 (Reuters) - Italy\\'s Fiat and India\\'s Tata Motors have agreed to build cars, engines and\\ntransmissions for India in a joint venture that could eventually extend to other markets such as Argentina.\\n\\nThe deal would allow Fiat, Europe\\'s fifth-biggest automaker, to expand in a potentially huge market as well as\\nhelp it increase the scale of its relatively small production volume.\\n\\nFor Tata , India\\'s third-biggest automaker, it could help it recover its place in Europe after it lost its British\\npartner in 2005 with the demise of MG Rover.\\n\\n\"Both companies have complementary strengths, convergent objectives and shared values (and) together,\\nwe can meaningfully address markets in India and other select geographies,\" Tata Chairman Ratan Tata said\\nin a statement.\\n\\nFiat and Tata agreed to look at cooperating on trucks in India after Fiat\\'s Iveco truck unit sold its stake in\\nIndia\\'s number two truck maker, Ashok Leyland on Monday.\\n\\n\"It does throw up an opportunity ... we will look at it closely and seriously,\" Tata Managing Director Ravi Kant\\nsaid.\\n\\nThey have also agreed to conduct a 60-day study into possibly using Fiat\\'s underused plant in Cordoba,\\nArgentina, to make vehicles under both brands.\\n\\nThe deal is an extension of an agreement between the two automakers to share dealer networks in India.

In addition, the joint venture will meet the needs of practically every carmaker\\nin the country.\\n\\nTarang Jain, managing director, Varroc, told DNA Money that the joint venture\\'s initial investment at Chakan\\nwould be in the range of 20 million euro (Rs 120 crore), with production of nearly 500,000 bumpers annually.\\n\\n\"Our French partner will also be setting up a technical centre at Chakan, which will focus on specialised\\ntechnology for bumpers.

The quantity sourced by Fedders\\nwould be marketed separately under its own brands.\\n\\nAnalysts said the move would positively impact the company\\'s bottomline as working capital and employee\\ncosts would be lower. Hence, the margins on marketing alone would\\n\\nbe higher.

Others seen from left are: Tim Wade, MD, AMP International, S. V. Mony, CEO of AMP\\nSanmar, Penelope Anne Wensley,\\n\\nHigh Commissioner of Australia in India, and N. Sankar, Chairman, the Sanmar group. - Photo: T. A. Hafeez\\n\\nCHENNAI, JAN.  . The over  -year-old Australian financial service company, AMP International, will have\\na `significant management influence\\' in the  :  life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched\\nhere today.\\n\\nThough it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance\\nCompany, the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant\\n\\nmanagement influence\\' will, according to Tim Wade, Managing Director of AMP International, \"help AMP\\nbring all its skills to bear more quickly, efficiently and effectively.\"\\n\\nNot surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint\\nventure to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP\\ngets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new\\nbusiness outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says.\\n\\nUnlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed\\nagency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model\\noutside its core markets.\\n\\n\"It is important that AMP gets it right here. That is why India is very high on our priority list,\" Mr. Wade says.\\n\\nBeing a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the\\nother hand, is `highly fragmented\\'.\\n\\nThough AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically\\nin the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic\\nsavings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent.\\n\\nThat AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have\\nentered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won\\'t\\nhave lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be\\n\"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is\\ntrained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts.\\n\\nMr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance\\nproduct per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve.\\nAs the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of\\ninsurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don\\'t do it, customers will go competitors,\" he\\nreasons.\\n\\nAccording to S.V. Mony, Chief Executive Officer, the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than\\nothers\". A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before\\nFebruary-end,\" he claims.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment? Striking alliances with\\ncorporates, carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches, moving of qualified advisers to\\ntowns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers. \"We have gone into a\\nrigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand. A brand strategy document is\\nevolved at micro as well macro levels,\" says Mr. Mony. \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building\\npolicy which will align with our business strategy,\" he adds.\\n\\nMr. Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs.   crores in the first full year of operation with a\\npolicyholder base of  , . He expects the sum assured by the joint venture to be around Rs.   crores by\\nthen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneral/also in this issue\\nVF DEAL WILL BOOST PRESENCE IN INDIA\\n\\nRoss Tucker\\n  words\\n  September  \\nWomen\\'s Wear Daily\\nWWD\\n \\nEnglish\\nCopyright   Fairchild Publications, Inc.

Currently, Concor\\nhas a container train operating licence through which it is permitted to move cars within containers. But if it\\nwants to bring in specially designed wagons for car transportation it will have to obtain another SFTO licence\\nunder the Railway Ministry\\'s proposed policy.\\n\\nThe fast-growing car transportation market in India is served primarily by the road sector, which provides\\nend-to-end service and is usually cheaper than railways. Some container train operators such as Concor and\\nAdani Group\\'s container train operating arm do move cars on containers on certain routes. But they have not\\nbeen able to grab any significant share, yet.\\n\\nSFTO POLICY\\n\\nThe Railway Ministry is in the process of finalising the SFTO scheme. SFTOs will be companies that invest in\\nprocurement of rakes and arrange traffic for loading/unloading in Special Freight Trains (SFT), owned by\\nthem after obtaining necessary permission from the Railway Ministry. Under the scheme — as listed in the\\nMinistry\\'s draft policy — the firms wanting to be SFTOs have to obtain a licence for moving a specified\\ncategory of goods. For instance, in this case, the Concor-NYK joint venture will apply for SFTO licence to\\nservice the automobile sector. The licence can be obtained through a two-stage competitive bid — technical\\nand financial. However, the exact contours will clear only after the Ministry finalises the policy.\\n\\nCONCOR\\'s EVALUATION\\n\\n“We are currently moving cars by containers in limited circuits. We have also imported some special\\ncontainers that can carry more cars. But this is also an area where the Railway Ministry is working on a\\nseparate policy. We are looking at that policy. We will see if we want to operate car carriers regularly,” Mr Anil\\nK. Gupta, Managing Director, Concor, told Business Line. He added that Concor will evaluate the SFTO\\nlicence for its joint venture company with NYK.\\n\\nLast year, Concor had set up a  :  joint venture company with NYK Line to provide end-to-end car\\ntransportation services to automobile manufacturers, with a focus on rail-based transportation. NYK of Japan\\nis known for its expertise in operating automobile terminals and its extensive fleet of Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off)\\nships. In India, NYK has a memorandum of understanding with Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone\\n(MPSEZ) to set up a world-class dedicated automobile terminal. About three years ago, Concor had tried\\nintroducing specially designed wagons to move cars. But the project did not take off because the haulage\\ncharges decided by the Railways for moving the specially designed wagons were high and rendered the\\nproject financially unviable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcor, NYK in Joint Venture\\n\\nJOC STAFF\\n  words\\n  May  \\nJournal of Commerce Online\\nJOCO\\nEnglish\\n(c)   Commonwealth Business Media.

The over  -year-old Australian financial service company, AMP International, will have\\na `significant management influence\\' in the  :  life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched\\nhere today.\\n\\nThough it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance\\nCompany, the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant\\n\\nmanagement influence\\' will, according to Tim Wade, Managing Director of AMP International, \"help AMP\\nbring all its skills to bear more quickly, efficiently and effectively.\"\\n\\nNot surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint\\nventure to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP\\ngets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new\\nbusiness outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says.\\n\\nUnlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed\\nagency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model\\noutside its core markets.\\n\\n\"It is important that AMP gets it right here. That is why India is very high on our priority list,\" Mr. Wade says.\\n\\nBeing a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the\\nother hand, is `highly fragmented\\'.\\n\\nThough AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically\\nin the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic\\nsavings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent.\\n\\nThat AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have\\nentered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won\\'t\\nhave lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be\\n\"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is\\ntrained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts.\\n\\nMr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance\\nproduct per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve.\\nAs the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of\\ninsurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don\\'t do it, customers will go competitors,\" he\\nreasons.\\n\\nAccording to S.V. Mony, Chief Executive Officer, the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than\\nothers\". A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before\\nFebruary-end,\" he claims.\\n\\n\\nHow could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment? Striking alliances with\\ncorporates, carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches, moving of qualified advisers to\\ntowns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers. \"We have gone into a\\nrigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand. A brand strategy document is\\nevolved at micro as well macro levels,\" says Mr. Mony. \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building\\npolicy which will align with our business strategy,\" he adds.\\n\\nMr. Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs.   crores in the first full year of operation with a\\npolicyholder base of  , . He expects the sum assured by the joint venture to be around Rs.   crores by\\nthen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneral/also in this issue\\nVF DEAL WILL BOOST PRESENCE IN INDIA\\n\\nRoss Tucker\\n  words\\n  September  \\nWomen\\'s Wear Daily\\nWWD\\n \\nEnglish\\nCopyright   Fairchild Publications, Inc.

Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, which are setting up a joint venture (JV) to\\nmake light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in India, will together invest $  million (Rs ,  crore) in the\\nproject.\\n\\nThis is the second venture that Nissan has signed in India. It is already setting up a manufacturing facility with\\nMahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in Chennai along with partner Renault SA.\\n\\nNissan and Renault teamed up in  , and the latter holds a  . % stake in Nissan, while the former owns\\n % in Renault. Separately, Renault makes the Logan car in India with M&M and plans to make inexpensive,\\nsmall cars with Bajaj Auto Co.\\n\\n“There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and chief\\nexecutive officer of Nissan, who is also the CEO of Renault.\\n\\nThe Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor\\nCo.’s Ace, which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment. The JV will make trucks in the range of\\n . -  tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). At the lower end of the lower range, a GVW of  .  would mean a\\npayload (goods carrying) capacity of  .  tonnes. This category has gained in popularity after a court ruling\\nbanned overloading of trucks, forcing goods carriers to ship goods to a central warehouse (on large or heavy\\ntrucks) for redistribution to multiple locations using smaller trucks. Previously, overloaded trucks would serve\\nseveral locations, offloading goods as they went along.\\n\\nNissan and Ashok Leyland’s light truck project will operate through three companies. The first, in which Ashok\\nLeyland will hold a  % stake, will manufacture the trucks and will be responsible for sales. The second,\\nwhere Nissan will hold a  % stake, will manufacture engines for the trucks; and the third, where both Ashok\\nLeyland and Nissan will hold equal stakes, will be a technology development company that will design new\\nproducts and engines.\\n\\n“This move will transform ALL ( Ashok Leyland) from a peripheral LCV player to a significant market\\nparticipant,” said Amit Kosat and Rohan A. Korde, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a report\\nreleased after the initial announcement was made. Leyland “will be able to boast a complete portfolio of CVs\\n(commercial vehicles) once the JVs with Nissan get operationalized”, their report added.\\n\\nThe manufacturing company will make products under two brand names, Ashok Leyland and Nissan, and\\nthere would be “significant price difference” between the two brands, said R. Seshasayee, managing director\\nof Ashok Leyland. The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan\\none. Though there will be two different brand names, Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding\\nbetween Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the returns to both firms would be same.\\n\\nThe Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher\\nlending rates; however, sales have grown in the sub- .  tonne GVW segment and the more than  . -tonne\\nGVW one.\\n\\nFrom around  % market share by volume in the truck segment in  - , the sub- .  tonne segment now\\naccounts for  % of the market. Nissan sold close of half million LCVs in  .\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two proposed manufacturing firms have not yet identified the location for the project to manufacture\\ntrucks and engines, but has shortlisted three states—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand—as\\npossible locations for the plants. The technology development firm will be based in Chennai.\\n\\nThe truck manufacturing company will initially have a capacity of  .  million units per annum, which will be\\ndoubled by  ; production starts in  . The engine manufacturing company will also supply to Nissan’s\\nproduction plants outside India, apart from supplying to the LCV project in India, Seshasayee said.\\n\\nAmong the first vehicles being planned for launch is Nissan’s new Atlas F  light duty truck, which has a\\nGVW of less than five tonnes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPanacea ties up with Britain\\'s Chiron for new vaccines\\n\\n  words\\n  November  \\nHindustan Times\\nHNTM\\nEnglish\\n(c)   The Hindustan Times Ltd\\nIndo-Asian News Service\\n\\nMumbai, Nov   -- Panacea Biotec, one of India\\'s leading biotechnology companies, Wednesday entered into\\nan agreement with Britain\\'s Chiron Vaccines to launch new vaccines in the local market.\\n\\nAs part of the agreement, a new joint venture, Chiron Panacea Vaccines, has been floated with equal\\nparticipation of both the companies, said Rajesh Jain, joint managing director of Panacea Biotec.\\n\\nChiron Panacea Vaccines will bridge the technology gap to produce innovative fully liquid paediatric\\ncombination vaccines, he told a press conference here, adding the alliance will provide India with a key\\ncompetitive advantage.\\n\\n\"We are delighted that Panacea Biotec is taking a world leading role by forming this joint venture with Chiron\\nVaccines to market highly advanced technology driven vaccines,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The vaccine world is undergoing a radical rethink about how vaccines might be stored and administered.

Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, which are setting up a joint venture (JV) to\\nmake light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in India, will together invest $  million (Rs ,  crore) in the\\nproject.\\n\\nThis is the second venture that Nissan has signed in India. It is already setting up a manufacturing facility with\\nMahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in Chennai along with partner Renault SA.\\n\\nNissan and Renault teamed up in  , and the latter holds a  . % stake in Nissan, while the former owns\\n % in Renault. Separately, Renault makes the Logan car in India with M&M and plans to make inexpensive,\\nsmall cars with Bajaj Auto Co.\\n\\n“There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and chief\\nexecutive officer of Nissan, who is also the CEO of Renault.\\n\\nThe Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor\\nCo.’s Ace, which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment. The JV will make trucks in the range of\\n . -  tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). At the lower end of the lower range, a GVW of  .  would mean a\\npayload (goods carrying) capacity of  .  tonnes. This category has gained in popularity after a court ruling\\nbanned overloading of trucks, forcing goods carriers to ship goods to a central warehouse (on large or heavy\\ntrucks) for redistribution to multiple locations using smaller trucks. Previously, overloaded trucks would serve\\nseveral locations, offloading goods as they went along.\\n\\nNissan and Ashok Leyland’s light truck project will operate through three companies. The first, in which Ashok\\nLeyland will hold a  % stake, will manufacture the trucks and will be responsible for sales. The second,\\nwhere Nissan will hold a  % stake, will manufacture engines for the trucks; and the third, where both Ashok\\nLeyland and Nissan will hold equal stakes, will be a technology development company that will design new\\nproducts and engines.\\n\\n“This move will transform ALL ( Ashok Leyland) from a peripheral LCV player to a significant market\\nparticipant,” said Amit Kosat and Rohan A. Korde, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a report\\nreleased after the initial announcement was made. Leyland “will be able to boast a complete portfolio of CVs\\n(commercial vehicles) once the JVs with Nissan get operationalized”, their report added.\\n\\nThe manufacturing company will make products under two brand names, Ashok Leyland and Nissan, and\\nthere would be “significant price difference” between the two brands, said R. Seshasayee, managing director\\nof Ashok Leyland. The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan\\none. Though there will be two different brand names, Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding\\nbetween Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the returns to both firms would be same.\\n\\nThe Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher\\nlending rates; however, sales have grown in the sub- .  tonne GVW segment and the more than  . -tonne\\nGVW one.\\n\\nFrom around  % market share by volume in the truck segment in  - , the sub- .  tonne segment now\\naccounts for  % of the market.

The company will be leveraging its direct-to-home (DTH) platform Big TV and recently\\nacquired Reliance Digicable to distribute the channels.\\n\\nReliance ADAG had announced the broadcast plans nearly three years ago.

The\\nmerchant swipes the customer\\'s card at the terminal or keys-in payment information and the terminal does\\nthe rest.\\n\\nCurrently, merchant establishments in India pay merchant acquiring banks between  .  and  .  per cent of\\nthe transaction value.

The new entity will be a good source of noninterest income, he\\nadded.\\n\\nBesides being a tool for acquiring and retaining merchant establishments as customers, the POS terminal will\\nalso further the cause of financial inclusion as it could be used as an alternative delivery channel in areas\\nwhere it is not feasible to set up a branch or an ATM, explained the official. As a further step towards\\nenhancing customer convenience in using the plastic money, the RBI has permitted cash withdrawals up to\\nRs  ,  a day per debit card issued in India at POS terminals.\\n\\nAmerchant establishment\\'s account gets credited by about Rs   for every Rs  ,  disbursed through the\\nswiping of the card. SBI has issued seven crore debit cards so far and the POS terminal would help increase\\ntheir usage.\\n\\nIn the future, the bank is also envisaging use of POS for mobile top-ups, utility bill payments, booking of\\nrailway and movie tickets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage   of   ©   Factiva, Inc.

The company is likely to roll out its GSM services across India by the end of this year, according\\nto Managing Director Anil Sardana.\\n\\nOutlook and Implications\\n\\nExpansion Into GSM: In October  , the Indian government allowed companies such as Reliance\\nCommunications and Tata Teleservices—a Tata Group company—to offer mobile services using GSM\\ntechnology in addition to their existing CDMA-based mobile services. Reliance, the country’s largest CDMA\\noperator, launched a nationwide GSM service by the end of last year (see India:   December  : ). Both\\nTata and Reliance are betting on their new services to create fresh growth momentum as GSM-based mobile\\nservices have been more popular among Indian mobile users. About three quarters of the country\\'s mobile\\nusers are now on the GSM platform.Strategic Alliance with DoCoMo: The tie-up with Japanese mobile giant\\nDoCoMo will also help Tata Teleservices enhance its position in the highly competitive Indian market. Apart\\nfrom much-needed capital, DoCoMo is also participating proactively in Tata Teleservices\\' management by\\nproviding human resources and technical assistance to help realise improved network quality and the\\nintroduction of leading-edge, value-added services (see Japan:   November  : ).Strategies for GSM\\nOfferings: Tata Teleservices has drawn up a capital-expenditure plan of US$  billion for the current fiscal\\nyear ending   March  , with a large proportion of the investment to be spent on rolling out its nationwide\\nGSM service. The company plans to enter the GSM segment by primarily targeting the mid and high end of\\nthe market. The company has said earlier that it does not intend to play the pricing game by offering low\\ntariffs to woo customers but plans to leverage its tie-up with NTT DoCoMo to offer rich value-added services\\nwhich do not exist in India at present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRPT-UPDATE  -Fiat, Tata form JV to build cars in India\\n\\n  words\\n  July  \\n : \\nReuters News\\nLBA\\nEnglish\\n(c)   Reuters Limited\\n(Repeats story issued late on Tuesday) (Recasts with joint venture, adds analyst comment, share price,\\nbackground)\\n\\nBy Rina Chandran\\n\\nMUMBAI, July   (Reuters) - Italy\\'s Fiat and India\\'s Tata Motors have agreed to build cars, engines and\\ntransmissions for India in a joint venture that could eventually extend to other markets such as Argentina.\\n\\nThe deal would allow Fiat, Europe\\'s fifth-biggest automaker, to expand in a potentially huge market as well as\\nhelp it increase the scale of its relatively small production volume.\\n\\nFor Tata , India\\'s third-biggest automaker, it could help it recover its place in Europe after it lost its British\\npartner in   with the demise of MG Rover.\\n\\n\"Both companies have complementary strengths, convergent objectives and shared values (and) together,\\nwe can meaningfully address markets in India and other select geographies,\" Tata Chairman Ratan Tata said\\nin a statement.\\n\\nFiat and Tata agreed to look at cooperating on trucks in India after Fiat\\'s Iveco truck unit sold its stake in\\nIndia\\'s number two truck maker, Ashok Leyland on Monday.\\n\\n\"It does throw up an opportunity ... we will look at it closely and seriously,\" Tata Managing Director Ravi Kant\\nsaid.\\n\\nThey have also agreed to conduct a  -day study into possibly using Fiat\\'s underused plant in Cordoba,\\nArgentina, to make vehicles under both brands.\\n\\nThe deal is an extension of an agreement between the two automakers to share dealer networks in India.

       "'Sanmar joins hands with Australian co. By Our Special Correspondent.   words   January   The Hindu THINDU English (c)   Katsuri & Sons Ltd The former President of India, R.Venkataraman, formally launching AMP Sanmar Assurance Company in Chennai on Monday. Others seen from left are: Tim Wade, MD, AMP International, S. V. Mony, CEO of AMP Sanmar, Penelope Anne Wensley, High Commissioner of Australia in India, and N. Sankar, Chairman, the Sanmar group. - Photo: T. A. Hafeez CHENNAI, JAN.  . The over  -year-old Australian financial service company, AMP International, will have a `significant management influence\\' in the  :  life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched here today. Though it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance Company, the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant management influence\\' will, according to Tim Wade, Managing Director of AMP International, \"help AMP bring all its skills to bear more quickly, efficiently and effectively.\" Not surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint venture to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP gets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new business outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says. Unlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed agency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model outside its core markets. \"It is important that AMP gets it right here. That is why India is very high on our priority list,\" Mr. Wade says. Being a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the other hand, is `highly fragmented\\'. Though AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically in the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic savings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent. That AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have entered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won\\'t have lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be \"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is trained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts. Mr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance product per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve. As the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of insurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don\\'t do it, customers will go competitors,\" he reasons. According to S.V. Mony, Chief Executive Officer, the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than others\". A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before February-end,\" he claims. How could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment? Striking alliances with corporates, carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches, moving of qualified advisers to towns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers. \"We have gone into a rigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand. A brand strategy document is evolved at micro as well macro levels,\" says Mr. Mony. \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building policy which will align with our business strategy,\" he adds. Mr. Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs.   crores in the first full year of operation with a policyholder base of  , . He expects the sum assured by the joint venture to be around Rs.   crores by then. general/also in this issue VF DEAL WILL BOOST PRESENCE IN INDIA Ross Tucker   words   September   Women\\'s Wear Daily WWD   English Copyright   Fairchild Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved VF Corp. has entered into a joint venture with India\\'s Arvind Mills Ltd. that will provide the American apparel giant with a platform to launch its portfolio of lifestyle brands in the world\\'s second-most populous country. According to a statement from Arvind, VF will pay $  million for a   percent ownership in the new venture, VF Arvind Brands Private Ltd., which initially will handle design, marketing and distribution responsibilities for the Lee, Wrangler, Nautica, JanSport and Kipling brands. Those brands were previously handled through a licensing and distribution agreement with Arvind subsidiary Arvind Fashions. \"Arvind Mills and the management team that built our Lee and Wrangler brand business in India over the last decade have been great partners,\" Mackey McDonald, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. \"Extending our partnership with this joint venture is a logical evolution of our strong relationship.\" Darshan Mehta has been named ceo of the venture, which will be based in Bangalore and employ   people. Mehta will report to Eric Wiseman, VF\\'s president and chief operating officer, who has been named chairman. Previously, Mehta served as president of Arvind Brands. Arvind launched Tommy Hilfiger in India through its nine freestanding stores in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkota, Hyderabad and Chennai. Last month, Arvind introduced the Gant brand in the country. In addition, the firm has several homegrown brands such as Excalibur, Flying Machine, Ruggers, Bay Island and Newport. In May, the company said it planned to open the Arvind Design Lab, a design center and showroom for its U.S. customers, in late summer in SoHo in New York. News of the latest joint venture came just after VF revealed the reorganization of its international management team with an eye toward increasing its overseas business to   percent of total revenues over the next three to five years. Karl Heinz Salzburger was named to the new post of president of Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia, and indicated that the Chinese, Indian and Russian markets would be a focus of the company\\'s expansion efforts. India\\'s rising middle class and population of more than   billion make it particularly attractive. \"The branded apparel market in India is approximately $ .  billion and continues to grow as consumers are becoming increasingly brand- and fashion-conscious,\" Mehta said in a statement. India already figures prominently in VF\\'s international business. According to the company, the Lee, Wrangler, Nautica, JanSport and Kipling brands currently generate $  million in wholesale volume in India. Those brands alone are expected to grow more than   percent per year. The joint venture also will allow the company to more easily introduce new brands into the market. \"Already, we\\'re at $ .  billion in revenue outside the U.S. As far as apparel companies go, that\\'s pretty big,\" said Wiseman last week. \"I look at China and India as important places to build the right brand foundation.\" VF reported $ .  billion in revenues in   and anticipates revenues growing   to   percent this year.

Bharti- Walmart to open first cash-and-carry store by December   words   February   UNI (United News of India) UNNIND English © Copyright  . UNI. All rights reserved. Report from UNI brought to you by HT Syndication. New Delhi, Feb.   -- The cash-and-carry joint venture of Wal-Mart and Bharti Enterprises is expected to open its first facility by December and Walmart has no problem in not using its brand name for the stores. Wal-Mart Stores Inc Vice Chairman Michael T Duke told reporters here today that it will have no problem in not using the Wal-Mart brand name for the cash-and-carry stores. To expedite matters and to get a first hand understanding on the progress of Wal-Mart\\'s joint venture with Bharti Enterprises for a cash-and-carry venture that will serve retailers, manufacturers and farmers Mr Duke and Wal-Mart Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer Rollin Ford are in India. The venture will provide retailers - kirana stores, fruit and vegetable resellers, restaurants and other business owners - with a wide range of quality products at competitive wholesale prices that will help them enhance their businesses and profitability. \\'\\'As we\\'ve studied the existing supply chain infrastructure in India we have been amazed by what we have learned,\" Mr Duke said. \\'\\'It\\'s a system that works. Yet, there is a need for increased efficiencies that can help minimise wastage, particularly of fresh foods and vegetables,\\'\\' he added. He said that the company\\'s goal is to work with the country\\'s existing supply chain infrastructure and improve efficiency to minimise wastage and maximise value for farmers and manufacturers as well as retailers. \\'\\'We can help cut the waste, not the middlemen who can play a very important part in the entire supply chain.\\'\\' The venture is expected to open   to   wholesale cash-and-carry facilities and employ approximately  ,  people over the next seven years.

Bharti, Wal-Mart see support in India for venture By Nicole Maestri   words   September    :  Reuters News LBA English (c)   Reuters Limited NEW YORK, Sept   (Reuters) - Despite protests from small traders, Bharti Enterprises and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are confident their Indian joint venture is supported in the country and will help usher in the future of Indian retail. \"I think it\\'s a big change for India, the move from mom-and-pop to organized retail,\" Raj Jain, head of Wal-Mart\\'s India operations, said in an interview on Monday. \"I think most people understand that it is a necessary evolution which has to go through for everybody to benefit from and for the economy. Bharti Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal echoed those comments. \"Farmers want this,\" he said in a separate interview on Tuesday. \"Customers want a better experience and to save money. They want it -- which means the country wants it.\" Mittal said the next generation\\'s perspective was not reflected in protests against change by mom-and-pop, or family-owned, stores. \"India is a young nation, and the son-and-daughter story has to take precedence over the mom-and-pop story,\" he said. In early August, Wal-Mart and Bharti announced an equal joint venture for a cash-and-carry, or wholesale, business and back-end supply chain management. Called Bharti Wal-Mart Private Limited, the joint venture is scheduled to open its first store by the end of  , selling groceries, consumer appliances and fruits and vegetables to retailers and small businesses. Large retail companies make up just   percent of India\\'s $  billion retail market. India allows foreign single-brand retailers to hold up to   percent in local joint ventures, while multiple-brand retailers like Wal-Mart are limited to cash-and-carry and franchise deals. But opening up a fragmented Indian industry dominated by family-run shops has triggered political concerns and protests by small shop owners who fear millions will lose their jobs. In August, Reliance Industries Ltd , the country\\'s biggest private company, delayed plans for hundreds of supermarkets in the north and east after India\\'s most-populous state shut   stores after protests from small traders. Jain said some family-owned stores have been \"embracing\" cash-and-carry since it will give them more \"buying leverage\" for goods at similar prices paid by bigger players. \"A lot of mom-and-pops see this is a way for them to be able to compete with organized retail,\" he said. Vendors ranging from Unilever and Procter & Gamble Co who \"know the game\" to small suppliers that make only one product are eager to work with the joint venture, he said. He said the venture was also working with medium-sized and small suppliers with learning what it takes to be a Wal-Mart supplier, from using bar codes to hooking up to the Internet. Wal-Mart and Bharti have not disclosed how much money they are putting into their venture. Bharti has previously said its retail arm would spend $ .  billion by   on multiple-format retail stores across India. Jain said Wal-Mart has not provided a figure largely because it does not yet know how much it will need to put into the venture, but he said: \"We will invest whatever it takes.\" DJ Ashapura Minechem, BHP,   Others In Aluminum JV Talks - Exec   words   August    :  Dow Jones Chinese Financial Wire DJCFWE English Copyright (c)  , Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LOGISTICS Concor-NYK Line venture mulls rail options for car transport   words   May   Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE   English (c)   The Hindu Business Line May go in for special freight train operator licence Mamuni Das New Delhi, May   Concor — through its  :  joint venture company with NYK Line, India — is evaluating the option to run car-carriers through the Railway Ministry\\'s Special Freight Train Operator (SFTO) scheme. Currently, Concor has a container train operating licence through which it is permitted to move cars within containers. But if it wants to bring in specially designed wagons for car transportation it will have to obtain another SFTO licence under the Railway Ministry\\'s proposed policy. The fast-growing car transportation market in India is served primarily by the road sector, which provides end-to-end service and is usually cheaper than railways. Some container train operators such as Concor and Adani Group\\'s container train operating arm do move cars on containers on certain routes. But they have not been able to grab any significant share, yet. SFTO POLICY The Railway Ministry is in the process of finalising the SFTO scheme. SFTOs will be companies that invest in procurement of rakes and arrange traffic for loading/unloading in Special Freight Trains (SFT), owned by them after obtaining necessary permission from the Railway Ministry. Under the scheme — as listed in the Ministry\\'s draft policy — the firms wanting to be SFTOs have to obtain a licence for moving a specified category of goods. For instance, in this case, the Concor-NYK joint venture will apply for SFTO licence to service the automobile sector. The licence can be obtained through a two-stage competitive bid — technical and financial. However, the exact contours will clear only after the Ministry finalises the policy. CONCOR\\'s EVALUATION “We are currently moving cars by containers in limited circuits. We have also imported some special containers that can carry more cars. But this is also an area where the Railway Ministry is working on a separate policy. We are looking at that policy. We will see if we want to operate car carriers regularly,” Mr Anil K. Gupta, Managing Director, Concor, told Business Line. He added that Concor will evaluate the SFTO licence for its joint venture company with NYK. Last year, Concor had set up a  :  joint venture company with NYK Line to provide end-to-end car transportation services to automobile manufacturers, with a focus on rail-based transportation. NYK of Japan is known for its expertise in operating automobile terminals and its extensive fleet of Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off) ships. In India, NYK has a memorandum of understanding with Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone (MPSEZ) to set up a world-class dedicated automobile terminal. About three years ago, Concor had tried introducing specially designed wagons to move cars. But the project did not take off because the haulage charges decided by the Railways for moving the specially designed wagons were high and rendered the project financially unviable. Concor, NYK in Joint Venture JOC STAFF   words   May   Journal of Commerce Online JOCO English (c)   Commonwealth Business Media. All rights reserved. State-owned Container Corp. of India entered a joint venture arrangement with NYK Line India, the local arm of Japan’s Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, to handle automobile movements by rail. The new venture, equally owned by both companies, plans to provide end-to-end transportation services to automakers, using specially-designed freight wagons. The move is aimed at lowering transportation costs to remain competitive with road transport operators that dominate the market. According to current indications, the company will initially cover the Delhi-Chennai sector, targeting the traffic moved by Maruti Suzuki, part of Suzuki Motors, and Hyundai Motor Company. Concor, an offshoot of Indian Railways, is the largest intermodal logistics provider in the country, with a network of nearly   inland depots. It enjoyed a total monopoly in container rail operations until the central government issued licenses to private operators in  . Tokyo-based NYK Line, which operates a fleet of over   car carriers, recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Mundra Port, a privately-owned cargo hub on the west coast, to develop a dedicated terminal for automobile exports. Currently, vehicle exports largely move through the Ports of Chennai and Mumbai, while Mundra recently started handling fortnightly calls of vessels operated by Nissan Motor Carrier Co. for transporting Suzuki shipments to Europe.

Rural markets Considering Godrej Hershey is on the verge of launching its mass chocolate portfolio, rural penetration will play a key role in getting its Hershey portfolio across these markets. “At present, Nutrine Confectionery generates a Rs  -crore turnover, out of which nearly   per cent of sales comes from rural markets which are served through whole-sellers and sub-distributors. However, we are hoping that the other FMCG companies in the group can help us deepen our rural distribution,” said Mr Mathur.

In August, Chubb gained approval for the joint venture from the government\\'s Ministry of Commerce and Industry (BestWire, Aug.  ,  ). The ministry\\'s Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion approved the proposal on the recommendation of India\\'s Foreign Investment Promotion Board. The  % stake Chubb has in the joint venture is the maximum allowable for a foreign company in India.

Hilton, EIH sign co-branding pact. By Our Bureau.   words   September   Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE English (c)   The Hindu Business Line The franchisee agreement, wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton, gives the foreign hotel major access to  ,  rooms in the domestic market. Mr David Michels, Group Chief Executive, Hilton Group plc, with Mr P.R.S. Oberoi, Chairman, EIH Ltd, at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday. - Paul Noronha Mumbai, Sept.   HILTON, among the best-known hotel brands globally, will now have a sizeable presence in India, courtesy a strategic co-branding alliance with EIH Ltd, which owns the Oberoi and Trident hotel chains. Accordingly, nine properties - existing Trident hotels at Agra, Kochi, Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Jaipur, Udaipur and proposed hotels at Gurgaon and North Mumbai - will be re-branded, Trident Hilton. Joining them, is the city\\'s landmark Oberoi Towers, which will be rechristened Hilton Towers. The franchisee agreement, wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton, gives the foreign hotel major access to  ,  rooms in the domestic market. More Trident properties may join the alliance, provided they meet required specifications. The alliance does not cover the Oberoi brand, inclusion of the Oberoi Towers to the fold being ascribed to existing plans for making it a Trident hotel. The property is not perceived to be of the same luxury levels as the new Oberoi next door. Mr S.S. Mukherji, Managing Director, EIH, said, Trident Hilton hotels would strive to be the best in its segment while the Oberoi brand would remain higher up in the heirarchy. The value distinction between the two brands will thus continue, notwithstanding the Hilton alliance. Also, Trident will likely stay a domestic brand while EIH\\'s expansion overseas will be with the Oberoi brand. Strategic alliance for the Oberoi brand is currently not being considered, Mr Mukherji said. At a press briefing attended by Mr P.R.S. Oberoi, Chairman & CEO, EIH, company officials said the move is not a prelude to equity participation by Hilton at EIH. But on likely spin-off for Trident, Mr Mukherji said, that was for the future to decide. Hilton usually operates owned properties, franchisee agreements reserved for trusted partners. The alliance between EIH and Hilton International (subsidiary of Hilton Group plc and Hilton Hotels Corporation) is for an initial   years, but Mr Oberoi said, the two were \"looking forward to a much longer relationship.\" Today\\'s agreement does not prevent EIH or Hilton from continuing their growth here through owned properties. \"It is possible that we will invest, but we will be wiser investors,\" Mr David Michels, Group Chief Executive, Hilton Group, said. He maintained, the timing of the alliance is correct for the simple reason that hoteliering post- /  has been difficult and it is a business that \"always comes back.\" It will take a year or two for the alliance to show result, but as business improves the Trident-Hilton alliance is expected to fetch properties here higher occupancy levels and better match between rack rates (published tariff) and actual rates. Key ingredients would be Hilton\\'s reservation system and clientele abroad, including its loyalty programme that boasts of eight million regular customers. Mr Michels said, the foreign major is also interested in growing outbound travel from India, prospective business for Hilton properties elsewhere in the world.

Getting into high-strength alloys is a part of our strategic growth initiative. Today,   per cent of our products are value added and we expect to scale this up, going forward\". According to Debu Bhattacharya, managing director, Hindalco, the new initiative is a great opportunity for Hindalco at a time when the aviation industry is slated to be on an upswing. Its foray in this segment catapults Hindalco into a different league, joining as it does an exclusive band of global players in this high technology sector. The company sources said that a high proportion of the new company\\'s output will be marketed overseas. India currently has small demand for HSA alloys but over time this demand is likely to grow as well, as India\\'s aerospace sector takes off.

Software AG, IGate Set Up Joint Venture In India   words   August    :  Dow Jones International News DJI English (Copyright (c)  , Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Edited Press Release DARMSTADT, Germany -(Dow Jones)- Software AG (G.SWR) and iGate Global Solutions (IGTE) have agreed to jointly set up and operate an offshore development and service center in India under the name Software AG (India) Private Ltd, Software AG said Tuesday. SAG India will focus on services for application development, ASF, application management and maintenance, AMS, and professional services projects, PSP. The joint venture company will be located in Pune in the Region of Mumbai (Bombay). Operations are planned to start in October   with an initial workforce of about  . The number will be increased as business develops. The German/Indian joint venture is in line with Software AG\\'s strategy to develop and market new solutions in addition to their current technology product portfolio. The XML technology leader has initiated the development of solution platforms for mobile computing and content management. The next step is to build applications on top of them, serving general (horizontal) and industry-specific (vertical) needs. SAG India will concentrate on this area in the initial phase of its operations. \"Speed is a crucial factor in the field of standard applications. The professional experience of iGate GS will accelerate the process of going to market for our new solutions,\" explains Dr. Peter Mossack, Software AG\\'s CTO and member of the board, who will be the chairman of Software AG India. SAG India\\'s second business line will be project services. The company will provide offshore and onsite service engineers and programmers to complement Software AG\\'s local teams worldwide, with initial focus on Europe and the USA. This will allow for a more competitive cost base in customer projects. Furthermore, especially in the startup phase SAG India can draw on a large pool of iGATE GS\\'s skilled IT labor in India, which will guarantee a fast ramp-up of the new company. This will immediately provide Software AG\\'s local teams with a highly flexible and broadly-experienced skill resource pool, and with the ability to acquire larger projects than before. Application management and maintenance services will be SAG India\\'s third business line. Partly in order to cut costs and partly because of lack of skills, corporations and government agencies are turning to outsourcing of the operational support for their business applications. Software AG has already made first steps into this business segment, and expects to build market share with the help of its new partner. Commenting on the joint venture, Gerhard Watzinger, Chief Executive Officer of iGate GS, who was instrumental in structuring the arrangement said, \"We see an extremely robust growth opportunity in the burgeoning German market and the joint venture with Software AG further reinforces our established position in this region. However, the objective of this JV agreement goes beyond Germany, and is to provide world-class, cost-effective IT services to customers globally and thereby make a substantial contribution to their businesses. We are confident of the synergistic strengths both partners bring to the table and believe that the venture provides a classic \\'win-win\\' proposition.\" The joint venture will be established as a private limited company. Software AG will hold  %, iGATE GS  % of the equity ( ,  Euro). Each of the parent companies will be represented on the Board by two directors. Operations will be managed by General Manager Rajan Bhatnagar. Software AG took the decision after carefully analyzing the offshore markets. The target of lowering costs for software engineering in solutions development and projects was the trigger to look for offshore resources. However, the offshore partner also had to meet up to Software AG\\'s high standard of quality, and add skills Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. that complement the leading technology know-how in the field of standard applications and outsourcing. Last but not least, the joint venture partners should be of equal size to provide a similar level of management attention. iGate GS and Software AG are a perfect match. Both expect to draw substantial synergies from the partnership, which is laid out for significant further growth, a long business relationship and expansion into other offshore markets.

Markets Invesco Buys Stake in Indian Fund Manager   words   September    :  The Wall Street Journal Online WSJO English Copyright   Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. MUMBAI—U.S. money-management firm Invesco Ltd., in an effort to expand its global footprint, has agreed to acquire a large stake in an Indian mutual-fund company. Invesco, which manages around $  billion in assets globally, said on Thursday that it would buy a  % stake in Religare Asset Management Co., a unit of Delhi-based financial services company Religare Enterprises Ltd. The companies didn\\'t disclose the size of the investment. But a person involved in the deal said Invesco has agreed to pay about $  million for the stake. Religare Asset Management managed $ .  billion in assets as of late August. Invesco\\'s entry to India comes just a few months after U.S. mutual-fund firm Fidelity Investments quit its Indian mutual-fund business, which was being run by its affiliate Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Fidelity\\'s fund unit in India notched losses every year since it opened in  . In March, the unit was sold to L&T Finance Ltd., part of India\\'s Larsen & Toubro Group. India\\'s fund industry, which had been growing rapidly until a few years ago, has lately struggled to attract investors. Returns from stock investments haven\\'t kept pace with the high returns provided by gold and real estate, which individual investors now prefer. Regulatory changes, including one that limited the amount of commission fund companies could pay salespeople, also hurt the sales of mutual funds. Investors have pulled money out of Indian stock mutual funds for seven out of eight months through August to the tune of $ .  billion, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Invesco, however, seems unfazed by the slowdown in India\\'s fund industry. \"We think there is a huge potential in India\\'s asset management industry,\" said Andrew Lo, chief executive of Invesco\\'s Asia Pacific unit. Given India\\'s large population and the fact that only a small portion of the people invest in mutual funds, there is a lot of scope for growth, said Mr. Lo. \"At some stage, [stock investors] will come back,\" said Mr. Lo. This is because India \"has a high savings rate, a high inflation and there is a need for people to invest,\" he added. Mr. Lo noted that that despite the tough conditions, Religare had managed to increase its assets and broken even. Some other foreign money managers also seem to have an optimistic view. Earlier this year, U.K.-based private-banking group Schroders PLC bought a  % stake in the asset-management arm of India\\'s Axis Bank Ltd. Analysts say that while foreign investment is welcome in India\\'s fund industry, companies will need to bring innovative products to attract investors. These could include introducing funds that provide exposure to global investments, said Rajesh Krishnamoorthy, managing director of Mumbai-based fund distributor iFAST Financial India. He said there is growing interest among some Indian investors to buy such funds. The joint venture, Religare Invesco Asset Management Co. will be headed by Saurabh Nanavati, chief executive of Religare Asset Management. Invesco currently employs around   people in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, to provide various back-office functions. Religare was advised on this deal by J.P.

The JV company will absorb L&T electronic equipment business - select assets, employees and dealer facilities. Meanwhile the company is importing various Sharp-manufactured fax machines, replying to the department of telecom\\'s query if the JV\\'s product list would include fax machines. The company has also got a confirmation from the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Assocation (TEMA) that none of their members are involved in manufacturing fascimiles in India to confirm that it would be impossible for the company to manufacture or commit to manufacturing of these machines. in case of fascimiles, company has also clarified that it is not dealing with customers directly but is providing these to dealers and wholesalers for onward sales to customers. The approved foreign equity amounts to Rs  .  crore and can be subsequently increased to Rs  .  crore in the paid-up capital of the JV. Sharp-L&T intends to introduce software-intensive high-technology products. These are typically of the low volume calls and hence the company does not intend to manufacture these. Since these models cater to specific customer categories, the demand quantities would not justify setting up a complete manufacturing facility, according to the company. However, these are freely importable under OGL and introduction would be phased and calibrated. The office automation products it proposes to introduce are highly technical and cannot be established in each operating region. Since these models cater to specific customer categories, the demand quantities would not justify setting up a complete manufacturing facility, the company adds. These digital office products and software-based solutions will be aimed at industry, small and big business enterprises and home-offices. The company also plans to establish service centres for service and customer care operations for the high-technology products while expanding the existing service infrastructure. LUPIN, ASPEN PHARMACARE TO FORM JV   words   February   Hindustan Times HNTM English (c)   The Hindustan Times Ltd Hindustan Times MUMBAI, India, Feb.   -- The Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (BSE) made the following corporate announcement: Lupin Ltd., has announced that the company and Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd., South Africa have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the establishment a  :  joint venture for the development, manufacture and global marketing (except US, South Africa & India Trade) of selected anti-TB products. While the company has traditional strengths in anti-TB formulations and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), Aspen will bring a range of MDR-TB products to the venture. Both parties believe that there would be synergies derived from the company\\'s traditional strengths and Aspen\\'s experience in the anti-retroviral business and Africa presence. There is a global trend of bundling the treatments of HIV, TB & malaria. As per current statistics,  .  million fresh TB cases get diagnosed every year and it is believed that only  % of the infected are diagnosed and a lesser percentage actually treated. Estimates by a study group constituted by WHO in   puts the market size at USD  -  million for the first line TB products. Out of this,  % of the market is considered to be Institutional and the balance is prescription based. The multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is caused by bacteria resistant to Rifampicin and/or INH or both drugs, is emerging as a major problem. While the cost of treatment of normal TB with first line drugs is estimated at USD  -  per patient, the MDR-TB treatment cost is substantially higher. The cost of treatment is about USD   per patient under WHO managed program as per Green Light Committee. The MDR-TB market is expected to grow exponentially over the next  -  years. The JV will also investigate opportunities to enter the malaria market. The total malarial market is estimated at approx. USD   million, of which  % is concentrated in Africa. Dr. D.B. Gupta, Chairman, of the company said, \"We believe that this is a very important step in providing comprehensive therapeutic care in the areas of conventional TB, MDR-TB and malaria, which are pandemic in nature and a concerted effort is required to provide treatment to the infected.

BAE to enter Indian armed forces venture By James Lamont in New Delhi and Sylvia Pfeifer in London   words   January   Financial Times (FT.Com) FTCOM English (c)   The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved BAE Systems, Europe\\'s largest defence contractor, is to expand its presence in the rapidly growing Indian market by setting up a joint venture focused on armoured vehicles. The company said on Wednesday that it had received approval from India\\'s foreign investment regulator to set up a partnership with vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra. The decision is an important step in the British company\\'s plans to build its defence business in India. Its ambitions are to position itself to participate in the modernisation of India\\'s armed forces, among the world\\'s largest, by entering partnerships with local companies. Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, described the decision as \"the first step\" in the group\\'s \"plans to [develop] long-term businesses in India in multiple sectors across the breadth and depth of the company\\'s global capabilities in land, sea, air and security\". The company has previously identified India as its seventh \"home market\" after Britain, the US, South Africa, Sweden, Australia and Saudi Arabia. BAE already has a £ . bn partnership with Hindustan Aeronautics to make   Hawk trainer jets for the Indian Air Force. In the future, the company may try to identify shipbuilding opportunities as India\\'s navy seeks to expand its fleet from its own dockyards rather than buying warships from other navies. India has been affected by the escalating costs of buying the General Gorshkov, the  , -tonne refitted aircraft carrier, from Russia. As part of the joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra, BAE is to transfer expertise from its US and South African operations in land systems. It regards the land-mine resistant vehicle technology developed by South Africa\\'s Land Systems OMC as particularly suited for the Indian market. Approval came after BAE filed an application in December to seek approval for a   per cent stake in the joint venture after India\\'s foreign investment regulator in October rejected a request for it to hold a   per cent stake. The Mahindra Group has said the joint venture would open export markets for Indian-made defence products. The big prize for BAE, however, remains a successful bid to supply   fighter jets in a $ bn (£ . bn) deal to overhaul India\\'s ageing Soviet-era strike force.

Asked why there has been a delay in the project, Mr Firodia said the physical part of the project, which included development of components, putting together the equipment and tools was well on schedule.

The joint venture will be structured through subsidiaries of Merck and Sun Pharma. The companies did not disclose financial details of the joint venture. A joint board consisting of members of senior management from Merck and Sun Pharmaceuticals will lead the joint venture. \"Merck\\'s emerging markets strategy is driven by our overarching focus on applying innovation across our business from introducing novel compounds to broadening our focus on innovative branded generics,\" said Kevin Ali, president, emerging markets, Merck. \"By combining forces with Sun Pharma, we are complementing our innovative product portfolio with a solid foundation for addressing the diverse needs of patients, physicians and governments across the emerging markets,\" he added.

Sankar, Chairman, the Sanmar group. - Photo: T. A. Hafeez CHENNAI, JAN.  . The over  -year-old Australian financial service company, AMP International, will have a `significant management influence\\' in the  :  life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched here today. Though it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance Company, the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant management influence\\' will, according to Tim Wade, Managing Director of AMP International, \"help AMP bring all its skills to bear more quickly, efficiently and effectively.\" Not surprisingly, AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market. Mr. Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint venture to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years.\" Yet, he is anxious that AMP gets its act right here in the sub-continent. \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new business outside our three core markets of Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.,\" he says. Unlike in Japan, where it has just made a foray, the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed agency-led distribution model\". This is, perhaps, the first time that the company is launching this model outside its core markets. \"It is important that AMP gets it right here. That is why India is very high on our priority list,\" Mr. Wade says. Being a dominant player in Australia, AMP has very little growth opportunity there. The U.K. market, on the other hand, is `highly fragmented\\'. Though AMP is among the top ten life firms there, Mr. Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically in the U.K.\" The opening up of the insurance sector, the size of the Indian population and high domestic savings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent. That AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus, unlike other foreign players who have entered the country, will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest. \"The significance is that we won\\'t have lot of competition in early period,\" avers Mr. Wade. Nonetheless, the USP of the joint venture will be \"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is trained as well as better than competitors,\" he asserts. Mr. Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance product per se to financial planning and wealth management. Surely, AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve. As the market in India evolves, AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of insurance products of competitors as well in India. \"If we don\\'t do it, customers will go competitors,\" he reasons. According to S.V. Mony, Chief Executive Officer, the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than others\". A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before February-end,\" he claims. How could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment? Striking alliances with corporates, carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches, moving of qualified advisers to towns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers. \"We have gone into a rigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand. A brand strategy document is evolved at micro as well macro levels,\" says Mr. Mony. \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building policy which will align with our business strategy,\" he adds. Mr. Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs.   crores in the first full year of operation with a policyholder base of  , . He expects the sum assured by the joint venture to be around Rs.   crores by then. general/also in this issue VF DEAL WILL BOOST PRESENCE IN INDIA Ross Tucker   words   September   Women\\'s Wear Daily WWD   English Copyright   Fairchild Publications, Inc.

The joint venture also will allow the company to more easily introduce new brands into the market. \"Already, we\\'re at $ .  billion in revenue outside the U.S. As far as apparel companies go, that\\'s pretty big,\" said Wiseman last week. \"I look at China and India as important places to build the right brand foundation.\" VF reported $ .  billion in revenues in   and anticipates revenues growing   to   percent this year.

Mukherji, Managing Director, EIH, said, Trident Hilton hotels would strive to be the best in its segment while the Oberoi brand would remain higher up in the heirarchy. The value distinction between the two brands will thus continue, notwithstanding the Hilton alliance. Also, Trident will likely stay a domestic brand while EIH\\'s expansion overseas will be with the Oberoi brand. Strategic alliance for the Oberoi brand is currently not being considered, Mr Mukherji said. At a press briefing attended by Mr P.R.S. Oberoi, Chairman & CEO, EIH, company officials said the move is not a prelude to equity participation by Hilton at EIH. But on likely spin-off for Trident, Mr Mukherji said, that was for the future to decide. Hilton usually operates owned properties, franchisee agreements reserved for trusted partners. The alliance between EIH and Hilton International (subsidiary of Hilton Group plc and Hilton Hotels Corporation) is for an initial   years, but Mr Oberoi said, the two were \"looking forward to a much longer relationship.\" Today\\'s agreement does not prevent EIH or Hilton from continuing their growth here through owned properties. \"It is possible that we will invest, but we will be wiser investors,\" Mr David Michels, Group Chief Executive, Hilton Group, said. He maintained, the timing of the alliance is correct for the simple reason that hoteliering post- /  has been difficult and it is a business that \"always comes back.\" It will take a year or two for the alliance to show result, but as business improves the Trident-Hilton alliance is expected to fetch properties here higher occupancy levels and better match between rack rates (published tariff) and actual rates. Key ingredients would be Hilton\\'s reservation system and clientele abroad, including its loyalty programme that boasts of eight million regular customers. Mr Michels said, the foreign major is also interested in growing outbound travel from India, prospective business for Hilton properties elsewhere in the world.

The company sources said that a high proportion of the new company\\'s output will be marketed overseas.

While, Hindalco is currently the largest aluminium company in India with a turnover of over Rs  , .  crore.

Software AG, IGate Set Up Joint Venture In India   words   August    :  Dow Jones International News DJI English (Copyright (c)  , Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Edited Press Release DARMSTADT, Germany -(Dow Jones)- Software AG (G.SWR) and iGate Global Solutions (IGTE) have agreed to jointly set up and operate an offshore development and service center in India under the name Software AG (India) Private Ltd, Software AG said Tuesday. SAG India will focus on services for application development, ASF, application management and maintenance, AMS, and professional services projects, PSP. The joint venture company will be located in Pune in the Region of Mumbai (Bombay). Operations are planned to start in October   with an initial workforce of about  . The number will be increased as business develops. The German/Indian joint venture is in line with Software AG\\'s strategy to develop and market new solutions in addition to their current technology product portfolio. The XML technology leader has initiated the development of solution platforms for mobile computing and content management. The next step is to build applications on top of them, serving general (horizontal) and industry-specific (vertical) needs. SAG India will concentrate on this area in the initial phase of its operations. \"Speed is a crucial factor in the field of standard applications. The professional experience of iGate GS will accelerate the process of going to market for our new solutions,\" explains Dr. Peter Mossack, Software AG\\'s CTO and member of the board, who will be the chairman of Software AG India. SAG India\\'s second business line will be project services. The company will provide offshore and onsite service engineers and programmers to complement Software AG\\'s local teams worldwide, with initial focus on Europe and the USA. This will allow for a more competitive cost base in customer projects. Furthermore, especially in the startup phase SAG India can draw on a large pool of iGATE GS\\'s skilled IT labor in India, which will guarantee a fast ramp-up of the new company. This will immediately provide Software AG\\'s local teams with a highly flexible and broadly-experienced skill resource pool, and with the ability to acquire larger projects than before. Application management and maintenance services will be SAG India\\'s third business line. Partly in order to cut costs and partly because of lack of skills, corporations and government agencies are turning to outsourcing of the operational support for their business applications. Software AG has already made first steps into this business segment, and expects to build market share with the help of its new partner. Commenting on the joint venture, Gerhard Watzinger, Chief Executive Officer of iGate GS, who was instrumental in structuring the arrangement said, \"We see an extremely robust growth opportunity in the burgeoning German market and the joint venture with Software AG further reinforces our established position in this region. However, the objective of this JV agreement goes beyond Germany, and is to provide world-class, cost-effective IT services to customers globally and thereby make a substantial contribution to their businesses. We are confident of the synergistic strengths both partners bring to the table and believe that the venture provides a classic \\'win-win\\' proposition.\" The joint venture will be established as a private limited company. Software AG will hold  %, iGATE GS  % of the equity ( ,  Euro). Each of the parent companies will be represented on the Board by two directors. Operations will be managed by General Manager Rajan Bhatnagar. Software AG took the decision after carefully analyzing the offshore markets. The target of lowering costs for software engineering in solutions development and projects was the trigger to look for offshore resources. However, the offshore partner also had to meet up to Software AG\\'s high standard of quality, and add skills that complement the leading technology know-how in the field of standard applications and outsourcing. Last but not least, the joint venture partners should be of equal size to provide a similar level of management attention. iGate GS and Software AG are a perfect match. Both expect to draw substantial synergies from the partnership, which is laid out for significant further growth, a long business relationship and expansion into other offshore markets.

Markets Invesco Buys Stake in Indian Fund Manager By Ashutosh Joshi And Kenan Machado   words   September    :  The Wall Street Journal Online WSJO English Copyright   Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. MUMBAI—U.S. money-management firm Invesco Ltd., in an effort to expand its global footprint, has agreed to acquire a large stake in an Indian mutual-fund company. Invesco, which manages around $  billion in assets globally, said on Thursday that it would buy a  % stake in Religare Asset Management Co., a unit of Delhi-based financial services company Religare Enterprises Ltd. The companies didn\\'t disclose the size of the investment. But a person involved in the deal said Invesco has agreed to pay about $  million for the stake. Religare Asset Management managed $ .  billion in assets as of late August. Invesco\\'s entry to India comes just a few months after U.S. mutual-fund firm Fidelity Investments quit its Indian mutual-fund business, which was being run by its affiliate Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Fidelity\\'s fund unit in India notched losses every year since it opened in  . In March, the unit was sold to L&T Finance Ltd., part of India\\'s Larsen & Toubro Group. India\\'s fund industry, which had been growing rapidly until a few years ago, has lately struggled to attract investors. Returns from stock investments haven\\'t kept pace with the high returns provided by gold and real estate, which individual investors now prefer. Regulatory changes, including one that limited the amount of commission fund companies could pay salespeople, also hurt the sales of mutual funds. Investors have pulled money out of Indian stock mutual funds for seven out of eight months through August to the tune of $ .  billion, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Invesco, however, seems unfazed by the slowdown in India\\'s fund industry. \"We think there is a huge potential in India\\'s asset management industry,\" said Andrew Lo, chief executive of Invesco\\'s Asia Pacific unit. Given India\\'s large population and the fact that only a small portion of the people invest in mutual funds, there is a lot of scope for growth, said Mr. Lo. \"At some stage, [stock investors] will come back,\" said Mr. Lo. This is because India \"has a high savings rate, a high inflation and there is a need for people to invest,\" he added. Mr. Lo noted that that despite the tough conditions, Religare had managed to increase its assets and broken even. Some other foreign money managers also seem to have an optimistic view. Earlier this year, U.K.-based private-banking group Schroders PLC bought a  % stake in the asset-management arm of India\\'s Axis Bank Ltd. Analysts say that while foreign investment is welcome in India\\'s fund industry, companies will need to bring innovative products to attract investors. These could include introducing funds that provide exposure to global investments, said Rajesh Krishnamoorthy, managing director of Mumbai-based fund distributor iFAST Financial India. He said there is growing interest among some Indian investors to buy such funds. The joint venture, Religare Invesco Asset Management Co. will be headed by Saurabh Nanavati, chief executive of Religare Asset Management. Invesco currently employs around   people in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, to provide various back-office functions. Religare was advised on this deal by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Indian law firm Amarchand Mangaldas. Invesco was advised by Indian law firm AZB Partners.

The JV company will absorb L&T electronic equipment business - select assets, employees and dealer facilities. Meanwhile the company is importing various Sharp-manufactured fax machines, replying to the department of telecom\\'s query if the JV\\'s product list would include fax machines. The company has also got a confirmation from the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Assocation (TEMA) that none of their members are involved in manufacturing fascimiles in India to confirm that it would be impossible for the company to manufacture or commit to manufacturing of these machines. in case of fascimiles, company has also clarified that it is not dealing with customers directly but is providing these to dealers and wholesalers for onward sales to customers. The approved foreign equity amounts to Rs  .  crore and can be subsequently increased to Rs  .  crore in the paid-up capital of the JV. Sharp-L&T intends to introduce software-intensive high-technology products. These are typically of the low volume calls and hence the company does not intend to manufacture these. Since these models cater to specific customer categories, the demand quantities would not justify setting up a complete manufacturing facility, according to the company. However, these are freely importable under OGL and introduction would be phased and calibrated. The office automation products it proposes to introduce are highly technical and cannot be established in each operating region. Since these models cater to specific customer categories, the demand quantities would not justify setting up a complete manufacturing facility, the company adds. These digital office products and software-based solutions will be aimed at industry, small and big business enterprises and home-offices. The company also plans to establish service centres for service and customer care operations for the high-technology products while expanding the existing service infrastructure. LUPIN, ASPEN PHARMACARE TO FORM JV   words   February   Hindustan Times HNTM English (c)   The Hindustan Times Ltd Hindustan Times MUMBAI, India, Feb.   -- The Bombay Stock Exchange Limited (BSE) made the following corporate announcement: Lupin Ltd., has announced that the company and Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd., South Africa have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the establishment a  :  joint venture for the development, manufacture and global marketing (except US, South Africa & India Trade) of selected anti-TB products. While the company has traditional strengths in anti-TB formulations and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), Aspen will bring a range of MDR-TB products to the venture. Both parties believe that there would be synergies derived from the company\\'s traditional strengths and Aspen\\'s experience in the anti-retroviral business and Africa presence. There is a global trend of bundling the treatments of HIV, TB & malaria. As per current statistics,  .  million fresh TB cases get diagnosed every year and it is believed that only  % of the infected are diagnosed and a lesser percentage actually treated. Estimates by a study group constituted by WHO in   puts the market size at USD  -  million for the first line TB products. Out of this,  % of the market is considered to be Institutional and the balance is prescription based. The multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is caused by bacteria resistant to Rifampicin and/or INH or both drugs, is emerging as a major problem. While the cost of treatment of normal TB with first line drugs is estimated at USD  -  per patient, the MDR-TB treatment cost is substantially higher. The cost of treatment is about USD   per patient under WHO managed program as per Green Light Committee. The MDR-TB market is expected to grow exponentially over the next  -  years. The JV will also investigate opportunities to enter the malaria market. The total malarial market is estimated at approx. USD   million, of which  % is concentrated in Africa. Dr. D.B. Gupta, Chairman, of the company said, \"We believe that this is a very important step in providing comprehensive therapeutic care in the areas of conventional TB, MDR-TB and malaria, which are pandemic in nature and a concerted effort is required to provide treatment to the infected. Lupin and Aspen together are best suited to address these disease areas.\" Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. BAE to enter Indian armed forces venture By James Lamont in New Delhi and Sylvia Pfeifer in London   words   January   Financial Times (FT.Com) FTCOM English (c)   The Financial Times Limited. All rights reserved BAE Systems, Europe\\'s largest defence contractor, is to expand its presence in the rapidly growing Indian market by setting up a joint venture focused on armoured vehicles. The company said on Wednesday that it had received approval from India\\'s foreign investment regulator to set up a partnership with vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra. The decision is an important step in the British company\\'s plans to build its defence business in India. Its ambitions are to position itself to participate in the modernisation of India\\'s armed forces, among the world\\'s largest, by entering partnerships with local companies. Ian King, chief executive of BAE Systems, described the decision as \"the first step\" in the group\\'s \"plans to [develop] long-term businesses in India in multiple sectors across the breadth and depth of the company\\'s global capabilities in land, sea, air and security\". The company has previously identified India as its seventh \"home market\" after Britain, the US, South Africa, Sweden, Australia and Saudi Arabia. BAE already has a £ . bn partnership with Hindustan Aeronautics to make   Hawk trainer jets for the Indian Air Force. In the future, the company may try to identify shipbuilding opportunities as India\\'s navy seeks to expand its fleet from its own dockyards rather than buying warships from other navies. India has been affected by the escalating costs of buying the General Gorshkov, the  , -tonne refitted aircraft carrier, from Russia. As part of the joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra, BAE is to transfer expertise from its US and South African operations in land systems. It regards the land-mine resistant vehicle technology developed by South Africa\\'s Land Systems OMC as particularly suited for the Indian market. Approval came after BAE filed an application in December to seek approval for a   per cent stake in the joint venture after India\\'s foreign investment regulator in October rejected a request for it to hold a   per cent stake. The Mahindra Group has said the joint venture would open export markets for Indian-made defence products. The big prize for BAE, however, remains a successful bid to supply   fighter jets in a $ bn (£ . bn) deal to overhaul India\\'s ageing Soviet-era strike force.

BP Nissan, Ashok Leyland ink $  mn pact John\\u200aSamuel\\u200aRaja\\u200aD.,john.s@livemint.com livemint   words   October   Mint HNMINT English Copyright  . HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Japanese car maker Nissan Motor Co. Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, which are setting up a joint venture (JV) to make light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in India, will together invest $  million (Rs ,  crore) in the project. This is the second venture that Nissan has signed in India. It is already setting up a manufacturing facility with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in Chennai along with partner Renault SA. Nissan and Renault teamed up in  , and the latter holds a  . % stake in Nissan, while the former owns  % in Renault. Separately, Renault makes the Logan car in India with M&M and plans to make inexpensive, small cars with Bajaj Auto Co. “There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and chief executive officer of Nissan, who is also the CEO of Renault. The Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor Co.’s Ace, which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment. The JV will make trucks in the range of  . -  tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). At the lower end of the lower range, a GVW of  .  would mean a payload (goods carrying) capacity of  .  tonnes. This category has gained in popularity after a court ruling banned overloading of trucks, forcing goods carriers to ship goods to a central warehouse (on large or heavy trucks) for redistribution to multiple locations using smaller trucks. Previously, overloaded trucks would serve several locations, offloading goods as they went along. Nissan and Ashok Leyland’s light truck project will operate through three companies. The first, in which Ashok Leyland will hold a  % stake, will manufacture the trucks and will be responsible for sales. The second, where Nissan will hold a  % stake, will manufacture engines for the trucks; and the third, where both Ashok Leyland and Nissan will hold equal stakes, will be a technology development company that will design new products and engines. “This move will transform ALL ( Ashok Leyland) from a peripheral LCV player to a significant market participant,” said Amit Kosat and Rohan A. Korde, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a report released after the initial announcement was made. Leyland “will be able to boast a complete portfolio of CVs (commercial vehicles) once the JVs with Nissan get operationalized”, their report added. The manufacturing company will make products under two brand names, Ashok Leyland and Nissan, and there would be “significant price difference” between the two brands, said R. Seshasayee, managing director of Ashok Leyland. The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan one. Though there will be two different brand names, Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding between Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the returns to both firms would be same. The Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher lending rates; however, sales have grown in the sub- .  tonne GVW segment and the more than  . -tonne GVW one. From around  % market share by volume in the truck segment in  - , the sub- .  tonne segment now accounts for  % of the market. Nissan sold close of half million LCVs in  . The two proposed manufacturing firms have not yet identified the location for the project to manufacture trucks and engines, but has shortlisted three states—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand—as possible locations for the plants. The technology development firm will be based in Chennai. The truck manufacturing company will initially have a capacity of  .  million units per annum, which will be doubled by  ; production starts in  . The engine manufacturing company will also supply to Nissan’s production plants outside India, apart from supplying to the LCV project in India, Seshasayee said. Among the first vehicles being planned for launch is Nissan’s new Atlas F  light duty truck, which has a GVW of less than five tonnes.

These are English general entertainment channel Big CBS Prime, youth entertainment channel Big CBS Spark and women-oriented channel Big CBS Love.

Currently, the English entertainment genre captures about  . % of the total television viewership. The channels will be on digital and analog and will be available in Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan. The company will be leveraging its direct-to-home (DTH) platform Big TV and recently acquired Reliance Digicable to distribute the channels. Reliance ADAG had announced the broadcast plans nearly three years ago. RBNL CEO Tarun Katial said, \"We restructured the company and completed the exercise nearly   months ago.

DTH demands first class content and if these channels are able to deliver that, then the growth opportunity is tremendous. Also, by looking at the roll out model, it seems like a long-haul game.

BANKING/FINANCE SBI picks   US firms for point-of-sale terminals deal   words   May   Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE   English (c)   The Hindu Business Line Visa, Elavon to help with payments technology solutions Our Bureau Mumbai, May   State Bank of India has zeroed-in on two US-based companies - Visa International and Elavon Inc - as joint venture partners for setting up a network of point-of-sale (POS) terminals across the country. The two foreign partners will help India\\'s biggest lender with payments technology solutions for its ambitious plan to roll out six lakh POS terminals at merchant establishments over the next five years. POS terminals are devices seen in retail and hospitality establishments for processing credit cards, debit cards, smart cards and other electronically submitted transactions in a traditional retail environment. A retail POS system includes a computer, monitor, cash drawer, receipt printer, customer display, barcode scanner, integrated card processing system, a signature capture device and a customer pin-pad device. The merchant swipes the customer\\'s card at the terminal or keys-in payment information and the terminal does the rest. Currently, merchant establishments in India pay merchant acquiring banks between  .  and  .  per cent of the transaction value. SBI is in the process of firming up the details of the joint venture, including signing of the memorandum of understanding, shareholders\\' agreement, capital structure and Foreign Investment Promotion Board approval for capital infusion, with its partners. The joint venture partners will be inducted into SBI Payment Services Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned company floated by the bank in January   for conducting merchant acquiring business. A senior official said SBI will have majority shareholding (over   per cent stake) even after the wholly owned subsidiary is converted into a joint venture. The new entity will be a good source of noninterest income, he added. Besides being a tool for acquiring and retaining merchant establishments as customers, the POS terminal will also further the cause of financial inclusion as it could be used as an alternative delivery channel in areas where it is not feasible to set up a branch or an ATM, explained the official. As a further step towards enhancing customer convenience in using the plastic money, the RBI has permitted cash withdrawals up to Rs  ,  a day per debit card issued in India at POS terminals. Amerchant establishment\\'s account gets credited by about Rs   for every Rs  ,  disbursed through the swiping of the card. SBI has issued seven crore debit cards so far and the POS terminal would help increase their usage. In the future, the bank is also envisaging use of POS for mobile top-ups, utility bill payments, booking of railway and movie tickets.   words   October    :  Dow Jones International News DJI English (c)   Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BP Nissan, Ashok Leyland ink $  mn pact John\\u200aSamuel\\u200aRaja\\u200aD.,john.s@livemint.com livemint   words   October   Mint HNMINT English Copyright  . HT Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved. Japanese car maker Nissan Motor Co. Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, which are setting up a joint venture (JV) to make light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in India, will together invest $  million (Rs ,  crore) in the project. This is the second venture that Nissan has signed in India. It is already setting up a manufacturing facility with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in Chennai along with partner Renault SA. Nissan and Renault teamed up in  , and the latter holds a  . % stake in Nissan, while the former owns  % in Renault. Separately, Renault makes the Logan car in India with M&M and plans to make inexpensive, small cars with Bajaj Auto Co. “There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India,” said Carlos Ghosn, president and chief executive officer of Nissan, who is also the CEO of Renault. The Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor Co.’s Ace, which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment. The JV will make trucks in the range of  . -  tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW). At the lower end of the lower range, a GVW of  .  would mean a payload (goods carrying) capacity of  .  tonnes. This category has gained in popularity after a court ruling banned overloading of trucks, forcing goods carriers to ship goods to a central warehouse (on large or heavy trucks) for redistribution to multiple locations using smaller trucks. Previously, overloaded trucks would serve several locations, offloading goods as they went along. Nissan and Ashok Leyland’s light truck project will operate through three companies. The first, in which Ashok Leyland will hold a  % stake, will manufacture the trucks and will be responsible for sales. The second, where Nissan will hold a  % stake, will manufacture engines for the trucks; and the third, where both Ashok Leyland and Nissan will hold equal stakes, will be a technology development company that will design new products and engines. “This move will transform ALL ( Ashok Leyland) from a peripheral LCV player to a significant market participant,” said Amit Kosat and Rohan A. Korde, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, in a report released after the initial announcement was made. Leyland “will be able to boast a complete portfolio of CVs (commercial vehicles) once the JVs with Nissan get operationalized”, their report added. The manufacturing company will make products under two brand names, Ashok Leyland and Nissan, and there would be “significant price difference” between the two brands, said R. Seshasayee, managing director of Ashok Leyland. The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan one. Though there will be two different brand names, Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding between Ashok Leyland and Nissan, the returns to both firms would be same. The Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher lending rates; however, sales have grown in the sub- .  tonne GVW segment and the more than  . -tonne GVW one. From around  % market share by volume in the truck segment in  - , the sub- .  tonne segment now accounts for  % of the market. Nissan sold close of half million LCVs in  . Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved. The two proposed manufacturing firms have not yet identified the location for the project to manufacture trucks and engines, but has shortlisted three states—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand—as possible locations for the plants. The technology development firm will be based in Chennai.

Reliance Broadcast Network (RBNL), the Rs  -crore media arm of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), has unveiled its broadcast plans in association with CBS Studios International, part of the US-based CBS Corporation. Under the  :  JV, christened Big CBS Networks, three English entertainment TV channels will be launched in October. These are English general entertainment channel Big CBS Prime, youth entertainment channel Big CBS Spark and women-oriented channel Big CBS Love. The channels target upper socio-economic class and will compete with other English entertainment channels such as Zee CafÃ©, Star World and AXN. Currently, the English entertainment genre captures about  . % of the total television viewership. The channels will be on digital and analog and will be available in Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan. The company will be leveraging its direct-to-home (DTH) platform Big TV and recently acquired Reliance Digicable to distribute the channels. Reliance ADAG had announced the broadcast plans nearly three years ago. RBNL CEO Tarun Katial said, \"We restructured the company and completed the exercise nearly   months ago. This gave us the opportunity to expand and build media verticals, which now also includes broadcast.\" CBS Studios International president Armando Nunez said, \"The size of the young audiences in India and digitisation creates the right environment. But we couldn\\'t enter this complex market alone. RBNL\\'s impressive combination of media assets makes it the right partner for us.\" \"We will fill the channel pricing with the government soon, \" he added. The channels are expected to start selling its advertising inventory in the coming months. It has short listed two ad agencies and will rollout the marketing initiative soon. Media planners are upbeat about the new launch. They feel while the other genres on the Indian television space are highly cluttered, there is good opportunity in the English entertainment space. Lodestar Universal CEO Shashi Sinha said, \"The issue of distribution will always be there but as the number of DTH homes increases, there is a good opportunity. DTH demands first class content and if these channels are able to deliver that, then the growth opportunity is tremendous. Also, by looking at the roll out model, it seems like a long-haul game. They will target limited users. To me, it\\'s a sound model. Also, the scope of growth through advertising inventory is immense.\" Reliance Industries , Pioneer Natural Resources Announce Eagle Ford Shale Joint Venture   words   June   Orissa Diary HTORIS English Copyright © by Mumbai, June   -- Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) today announced that its subsidiary, Reliance Eagleford Upstream LP, has executed definitive agreements to enter into a joint venture with United States based Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE: PXD), of Irving, Texas under which Reliance will acquire a  % interest in Pioneer\\'s core Eagle Ford Shale acreage position in two separate transactions.

BANKING/FINANCE SBI picks   US firms for point-of-sale terminals deal   words   May   Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE   English (c)   The Hindu Business Line Visa, Elavon to help with payments technology solutions Our Bureau Mumbai, May   State Bank of India has zeroed-in on two US-based companies - Visa International and Elavon Inc - as joint venture partners for setting up a network of point-of-sale (POS) terminals across the country. The two foreign partners will help India\\'s biggest lender with payments technology solutions for its ambitious plan to roll out six lakh POS terminals at merchant establishments over the next five years. POS terminals are devices seen in retail and hospitality establishments for processing credit cards, debit cards, smart cards and other electronically submitted transactions in a traditional retail environment.

The merchant swipes the customer\\'s card at the terminal or keys-in payment information and the terminal does the rest. Currently, merchant establishments in India pay merchant acquiring banks between  .  and  .  per cent of the transaction value. SBI is in the process of firming up the details of the joint venture, including signing of the memorandum of understanding, shareholders\\' agreement, capital structure and Foreign Investment Promotion Board approval for capital infusion, with its partners. The joint venture partners will be inducted into SBI Payment Services Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned company floated by the bank in January   for conducting merchant acquiring business. A senior official said SBI will have majority shareholding (over   per cent stake) even after the wholly owned subsidiary is converted into a joint venture. The new entity will be a good source of noninterest income, he added. Besides being a tool for acquiring and retaining merchant establishments as customers, the POS terminal will also further the cause of financial inclusion as it could be used as an alternative delivery channel in areas where it is not feasible to set up a branch or an ATM, explained the official. As a further step towards enhancing customer convenience in using the plastic money, the RBI has permitted cash withdrawals up to Rs  ,  a day per debit card issued in India at POS terminals. Amerchant establishment\\'s account gets credited by about Rs   for every Rs  ,  disbursed through the swiping of the card. SBI has issued seven crore debit cards so far and the POS terminal would help increase their usage. In the future, the bank is also envisaging use of POS for mobile top-ups, utility bill payments, booking of railway and movie tickets. Page   of   ©   Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.

Tatas, Fiat JV for commercial vehicles   words   February   The Times of India TOI English (c)   The Times of India Group MUMBAI: After entering into a joint venture agreement to make passenger cars in India last July, Tata Motors and Italy\\'s Fiat on Wednesday signed a new MoU to make commercial vehicles. The MoU between Tata Motors and Iveco, Fiat\\'s commercial vehicle arm, will explore ways to make and market these light and heavy trucks across the globe including India. Paolo Monferino, CEO, Iveco, said, \"We are looking at all areas of cooperation as of now. This includes sharing of product platforms, joint development of products, co-branding, licensing of products and even sharing manufacturing facilities. It is expected that the formal agreements will be signed in about   months.\" The partnership could begin with markets like India, Latin America, South Africa, China and Korea, Monferino added. The two companies have setup a joint panel to study the feasibility of cooperation. Although Iveco has not ruled out that it would look at establishing its presence in the Indian market alone, Monferino said that the entry would be through the alliance. This is Iveco\\'s second attempt to grab a pie of the fast growing Indian truck market. The company owned a minority stake in Ashok Leyland - the second largest commercial vehicle maker in India - for over a decade. However, with almost no contribution in running the business, the investment was treated purely as a financial one. \"With a minority stake, we were not a part of any governance in Ashok Leyland and our stake was more or less like a financial investment. We are keen to build an industrial presence in India and therefore exited the partnership with Ashok Leyland and now looking forward to the options we have with Tata Motors,\" Fiat CEO said. On the passenger vehicles front, Fiat and Tata Motors signed another MoU, which will see Tata Motor\\'s one-tonne pick-up being manufactured at Fiat\\'s plant in Cordoba, Argentina.

IHS Global Insight Perspective   Significance The launch will bring more competition in India’s already crowded GSM segment. Implications The expansion into the GSM segment is aimed at creating new growth momentum and increasing market competitiveness for Tata Teleservices. Outlook Tata Teleservices plans to enter the GSM segment by primarily targeting the mid and high end of the market and leveraging its tie-up with NTT DoCoMo to offer rich value-added services. Tata Teleservices plans to launch the GSM service in southern India this month and gradually expand it nationwide. The company is likely to roll out its GSM services across India by the end of this year, according to Managing Director Anil Sardana. Outlook and Implications Expansion Into GSM: In October  , the Indian government allowed companies such as Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices—a Tata Group company—to offer mobile services using GSM technology in addition to their existing CDMA-based mobile services. Reliance, the country’s largest CDMA operator, launched a nationwide GSM service by the end of last year (see India:   December  : ). Both Tata and Reliance are betting on their new services to create fresh growth momentum as GSM-based mobile services have been more popular among Indian mobile users.

ROOM FOR COOPERATION \"Tata\\'s parameters are vast,\" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Thierry Huon. \"There\\'s a lot of room for cooperation, even in trucks and agriculture equipment.\" The decision by Fiat to deepen relations with a partner in an emerging market is part of a wider trend followed by the world\\'s biggest automakers, including France\\'s Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen . Faced with rising costs and stagnant demand in their home markets, they are forming alliances with partners in developing countries that have greater growth prospects. The news comes a day after Fiat announced manufacturing deals with partners in China and Russia along with higher results for the second quarter. Tata also reported results below market forecasts.

BUSINESS & ECONOMY Varroc in JV with French company for auto exteriors Murali Gopalan   words   December   DNA - Daily News & Analysis DNADAI English Copyright  . Diligent Media Corporation Ltd. Plastic Omnium Auto Exterior will hold a  % stake The Rs  ,  crore Varroc group, based in Aurangabad, has entered into a joint venture with Plastic Omnium Auto Exterior of France to make automotive exterior components at a new plant in Chakan, Pune, to be operational next year. The French company will hold a  % stake in this venture, which will be called Plastic Omnium Varroc Pvt Ltd. The products planned for manufacture include bumpers, bumper modules, claddings, rocker panels, finishers, structural parts and painted body panels. Among the main clients targeted are the Bajaj Auto-Renault-Nissan alliance for the $ ,  small car, General Motors India and Volkswagen. In addition, the joint venture will meet the needs of practically every carmaker in the country. Tarang Jain, managing director, Varroc, told DNA Money that the joint venture\\'s initial investment at Chakan would be in the range of   million euro (Rs   crore), with production of nearly  ,  bumpers annually. \"Our French partner will also be setting up a technical centre at Chakan, which will focus on specialised technology for bumpers. This will be a great learning experience for us since we are not into auto exterior parts,\" he said. Given the cost-efficiencies and quality levels of Indian suppliers, Plastic Omnium could look at a buyback of some components manufactured in Chakan. Outsourcing of design is also a possibility with the new technical centre being part of the overall India plan. Varroc, which is targeting a turnover of nearly Rs  ,  crore this fiscal, has   plants in India and two in Poland and Italy. It is looking at business of   million euros (Rs  ,  crore) in Europe by  . \"We are eyeing turnover of Rs  ,  crore by that time with direct exports accounting for Rs   crore,\" Jain said. Gears up for the Bajaj car One of the more interesting aspects of the new Varroc joint venture is that it will supply bumpers to the ambitious $ ,  car project of Bajaj Auto scheduled to debut in  . It will be the most significant rival to the Tata Rs   lakh car that hits the roads next year. It is clear that all important vendors of Renault and Nissan (like Plastic Omnium in this case) will begin relocating to India. After all, they would benefit from the comparatively lower cost structure, especially when it is such an issue back home in Europe. The other big attraction, of course, is the Mahindra-Renault-Nissan alliance, which will produce derivatives of the Logan as well as compact hatchbacks from the Chennai facility. Voltas in   -   JV with Fedders.   words   June   Business Standard BSTN   English (c)   Business Standard Ltd. Our Corporate Bureau Mumbai/New Delhi Voltas said today it will form an equal \"manufacturing-only\" joint venture with Fedders Corporation of the US. The Tata Group company will hive off its AC manufacturing unit at Dadra to the joint venture which will be its equity contribution in kind, while Fedders will bring its   per cent contribution in cash. The venture has an equity base of Rs   crore. The marketing and distribution rights will be retained by Voltas, which will buy ACs from the venture and sell them through its existing network under the Voltas brand. ACs now contribute around   per cent to Voltas\\' turnover. Technical inputs from Fedd-ers and the advantage of global sourcing are expected to significantly benefit Voltas which, after six decades of dominance, has slipped to third position behind Carrier and LG, according to industry sources. In fact, in room ACs, Voltas is the fifth largest player with a marketshare of   per cent. In split ACs, it is the second largest with an   per cent share. Fedders also plans to use the joint venture as a global sourcing hub, which could significantly push up the  .  lakh-unit\\'s capacity utilisation. In addition, Voltas said the existing capacity would also be augmented. The quantity sourced by Fedders would be marketed separately under its own brands. Analysts said the move would positively impact the company\\'s bottomline as working capital and employee costs would be lower. Hence, the margins on marketing alone would be higher. Voltas is transferring   employees to the venture. Some   years ago, Fedders had entered into a technical collaboration with the Delhi-based Llyod Group. Though the agreement was not renewed, the joint venture-Fedders Llyod Ltd-continued to use the Fedders tradename in both the company\\'s registered name and its AC brand marketed in the country. In  , Fedders received government approval to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary. Fedders has since objected to its name being used by the Indian firm. When contacted today, Fedders Llyod vice-chairman and managing director BR Punj said: \"We are not bothered if the Voltas-Fedders JV sells Fedders brand ACs. We have been fighting them out in the courts.\" According to him, a case is being heard in the Delhi High Court.

- Despite protests from small traders  Bharti Enterprises and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are confident their Indian joint venture is supported in the country and will help usher in the future of Indian retail  \"I think it\\'s a big change for India  the move from mom-and-pop to organized retail \" Raj Jain  head of Wal-Mart\\'s India operations  said in an interview on Monday  \"I think most people understand that it is a necessary evolution which has to go through for everybody to benefit from and for the economy  Bharti Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal echoed those comments  \"Farmers want this \" he said in a separate interview on Tuesday  \"Customers want a better experience and to save money  They want it -- which means the country wants it \" Mittal said the next generation\\'s perspective was not reflected in protests against change by mom-and-pop  or family-owned  stores  \"India is a young nation  and the son-and-daughter story has to take precedence over the mom-and-pop story \" he said  In early August  Wal-Mart and Bharti announced an equal joint venture for a cash-and-carry  or wholesale  business and back-end supply chain management  Called Bharti Wal-Mart Private Limited  the joint venture is scheduled to open its first store by the end of    selling groceries  consumer appliances and fruits and vegetables to retailers and small businesses  Large retail companies make up just   percent of India\\'s    billion retail market  India allows foreign single-brand retailers to hold up to   percent in local joint ventures  while multiple-brand retailers like Wal-Mart are limited to cash-and-carry and franchise deals  But opening up a fragmented Indian industry dominated by family-run shops has triggered political concerns and protests by small shop owners who fear millions will lose their jobs  In August  Reliance Industries Ltd   the country\\'s biggest private company  delayed plans for hundreds of supermarkets in the north and east after India\\'s most-populous state shut   stores after protests from small traders  Jain said some family-owned stores have been \"embracing\" cash-and-carry since it will give them more \"buying leverage\" for goods at similar prices paid by bigger players  \"A lot of mom-and-pops see this is a way for them to be able to compete with organized retail \" he said  Vendors ranging from Unilever and Procter & Gamble Co who \"know the game\" to small suppliers that make only one product are eager to work with the joint venture  he said  He said the venture was also working with medium-sized and small suppliers with learning what it takes to be a Wal-Mart supplier  from using bar codes to hooking up to the Internet  Wal-Mart and Bharti have not disclosed how much money they are putting into their venture  Bharti has previously said its retail arm would spend      billion by   on multiple-format retail stores across India  Jain said Wal-Mart has not provided a figure largely because it does not

Business Line (The Hindu) BSNLNE   English (c)   The Hindu Business Line May go in for special freight train operator licence Mamuni Das New Delhi  May   Concor — through its  :  joint venture company with NYK Line  India — is evaluating the option to run car-carriers through the Railway Ministry\\'s Special Freight Train Operator (SFTO) scheme  Currently  Concor has a container train operating licence through which it is permitted to move cars within containers  But if it wants to bring in specially designed wagons for car transportation it will have to obtain another SFTO licence under the Railway Ministry\\'s proposed policy  The fast-growing car transportation market in India is served primarily by the road sector  which provides end-to-end service and is usually cheaper than railways  Some container train operators such as Concor and Adani Group\\'s container train operating arm do move cars on containers on certain routes  But they have not been able to grab any significant share  yet  SFTO POLICY The Railway Ministry is in the process of finalising the SFTO scheme  SFTOs will be companies that invest in procurement of rakes and arrange traffic for loading unloading in Special Freight Trains (SFT)  owned by them after obtaining necessary permission from the Railway Ministry  Under the scheme — as listed in the Ministry\\'s draft policy — the firms wanting to be SFTOs have to obtain a licence for moving a specified category of goods  For instance  in this case  the Concor-NYK joint venture will apply for SFTO licence to service the automobile sector  The licence can be obtained through a two-stage competitive bid — technical and financial  However  the exact contours will clear only after the Ministry finalises the policy  CONCOR\\'s EVALUATION “We are currently moving cars by containers in limited circuits  We have also imported some special containers that can carry more cars  But this is also an area where the Railway Ministry is working on a separate policy  We are looking at that policy  We will see if we want to operate car carriers regularly ” Mr Anil K  Gupta  Managing Director  Concor  told Business Line  He added that Concor will evaluate the SFTO licence for its joint venture company with NYK  Last year  Concor had set up a  :  joint venture company with NYK Line to provide end-to-end car transportation services to automobile manufacturers  with a focus on rail-based transportation  NYK of Japan is known for its expertise in operating automobile terminals and its extensive fleet of Ro-Ro (roll-on  roll-off) ships  In India  NYK has a memorandum of understanding with Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone (MPSEZ) to set up a world-class dedicated automobile terminal  About three years ago  Concor had tried introducing specially designed wagons to move cars  But the project did not take off because the haulage charges decided by the Railways for moving the specially designed wagons were high and rendered the project

Hindu Business Line The franchisee agreement  wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton  gives the foreign hotel major access to     rooms in the domestic market  Mr David Michels  Group Chief Executive  Hilton Group plc  with Mr P R S  Oberoi  Chairman  EIH Ltd  at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday  - Paul Noronha Mumbai  Sept    HILTON  among the best-known hotel brands globally  will now have a sizeable presence in India  courtesy a strategic co-branding alliance with EIH Ltd  which owns the Oberoi and Trident hotel chains  Accordingly  nine properties - existing Trident hotels at Agra  Kochi  Chennai  Bhubaneshwar  Jaipur  Udaipur and proposed hotels at Gurgaon and North Mumbai - will be re-branded  Trident Hilton  Joining them  is the city\\'s landmark Oberoi Towers  which will be rechristened Hilton Towers  The franchisee agreement  wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton  gives the foreign hotel major access to     rooms in the domestic market  More Trident properties may join the alliance  provided they meet required specifications  The alliance does not cover the Oberoi brand  inclusion of the Oberoi Towers to the fold being ascribed to existing plans for making it a Trident hotel  The property is not perceived to be of the same luxury levels as the new Oberoi next door  Mr S S  Mukherji  Managing Director  EIH  said  Trident Hilton hotels would strive to be the best in its segment while the Oberoi brand would remain higher up in the heirarchy  The value distinction between the two brands will thus continue  notwithstanding the Hilton alliance  Also  Trident will likely stay a domestic brand while EIH\\'s expansion overseas will be with the Oberoi brand  Strategic alliance for the Oberoi brand is currently not being considered  Mr Mukherji said  At a press briefing attended by Mr P R S  Oberoi  Chairman & CEO  EIH  company officials said the move is not a prelude to equity participation by Hilton at EIH  But on likely spin-off for Trident  Mr Mukherji said  that was for the future to decide  Hilton usually operates owned properties  franchisee agreements reserved for trusted partners  The alliance between EIH and Hilton International (subsidiary of Hilton Group plc and Hilton Hotels Corporation) is for an initial   years  but Mr Oberoi said  the two were \"looking forward to a much longer relationship \" Today\\'s agreement does not prevent EIH or Hilton from continuing their growth here through owned properties  \"It is possible that we will invest  but we will be wiser investors \" Mr David Michels  Group Chief Executive  Hilton Group  said  He maintained  the timing of the alliance is correct for the simple reason that hoteliering post-    has been difficult and it is a business that \"always comes back \" It will take a year or two for the alliance to show result  but as business improves the Trident-Hilton alliance is expected to fetch properties here higher occupancy levels and better match between rack rates (published tariff) and actual rates  Key ingredients would be Hilton\\'s reservation system and clientele abroad  including its loyalty programme that boasts of eight million regular customers  Mr Michels said  the foreign major is also interested in growing outbound travel from India  prospective

company  AMP International  will have a `significant management influence\\' in the  :  life insurance joint venture with the Sanmar group launched here today  Though it will have a lower presence of three in the seven-member board of AMP Sanmar Assurance Company  the Indian partner\\'s willingness to grant the overseas partner a `significant management influence\\' will  according to Tim Wade  Managing Director of AMP International  \"help AMP bring all its skills to bear more quickly  efficiently and effectively \" Not surprisingly  AMP is viewing India as a `crucial market  Mr  Wade agrees that \"we don\\'t expect the joint venture to be a major contributor to our balance sheet in the next five years \" Yet  he is anxious that AMP gets its act right here in the sub-continent  \"It (India) is where we are launching first full-fledged traditional new business outside our three core markets of Australia  New Zealand and the U K \" he says  Unlike in Japan  where it has just made a foray  the AMP joint venture in India will \"have a fully closed agency-led distribution model\"  This is  perhaps  the first time that the company is launching this model outside its core markets  \"It is important that AMP gets it right here  That is why India is very high on our priority list \" Mr  Wade says  Being a dominant player in Australia  AMP has very little growth opportunity there  The U K  market  on the other hand  is `highly fragmented\\'  Though AMP is among the top ten life firms there  Mr  Wade feels that \"we are not going to grow dramatically in the U K \" The opening up of the insurance sector  the size of the Indian population and high domestic savings rate have all proved enticing for AMP to set foot in the sub-continent  That AMP Sanmar Assurance has chosen to have South as its focus  unlike other foreign players who have entered the country  will itself differentiate the joint venture from the rest  \"The significance is that we won\\'t have lot of competition in early period \" avers Mr  Wade  Nonetheless  the USP of the joint venture will be \"simple and easy-to-understand value for money products delivered by a financial distribution system which is trained as well as better than competitors \" he asserts  Mr  Wade feels the emerging markets like India will take much less time to move from commodity insurance product per se to financial planning and wealth management  Surely  AMP is keen to stay ahead of the curve  As the market in India evolves  AMP - which is strong in distribution - will like to take up marketing of insurance products of competitors as well in India  \"If we don\\'t do it  customers will go competitors \" he reasons  According to S V  Mony  Chief Executive Officer  the joint venture \"will be in state of readiness faster than others\"  A whole lot of initiative on the IT front being currently undertaken will \"enable us to go online before February-end \" he claims  How could the skills of AMP in the business be translated into local environment  Striking alliances with corporates  carefully crafted progressive relationship with bank branches  moving of qualified advisers to towns are among the slew of initiatives the company is considering to gain customers  \"We have gone into a rigorous process of selecting people to promote the company and brand  A brand strategy document is evolved at micro as well macro levels \" says Mr  Mony  \"We have developed a carefully crafted brand building policy which will align with our business strategy \" he adds  Mr  Mony is looking at a premium collection of around Rs    crores in the first full year of operation with a policyholder base of      He expects the sum assured by the joint venture to be around Rs    crores by

 wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton  gives the foreign hotel major access to     rooms in the domestic market  Mr David Michels  Group Chief Executive  Hilton Group plc  with Mr P R S  Oberoi  Chairman  EIH Ltd  at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday  - Paul Noronha Mumbai  Sept    HILTON  among the best-known hotel brands globally  will now have a sizeable presence in India  courtesy a strategic co-branding alliance with EIH Ltd  which owns the Oberoi and Trident hotel chains  Accordingly  nine properties - existing Trident hotels at Agra  Kochi  Chennai  Bhubaneshwar  Jaipur  Udaipur and proposed hotels at Gurgaon and North Mumbai - will be re-branded  Trident Hilton  Joining them  is the city\\'s landmark Oberoi Towers  which will be rechristened Hilton Towers  The franchisee agreement  wherein EIH will pay a certain percentage of room sales as fee to Hilton  gives the foreign hotel major access to     rooms in the domestic market  More Trident properties may join the alliance  provided they meet required specifications  The alliance does not cover the Oberoi brand  inclusion of the Oberoi Towers to the fold being ascribed to existing plans for making it a Trident hotel  The property is not perceived to be of the same luxury levels as the new Oberoi next door  Mr S S  Mukherji  Managing Director  EIH  said  Trident Hilton hotels would strive to be the best in its segment while the Oberoi brand would remain higher up in the heirarchy  The value distinction between the two brands will thus continue  notwithstanding the Hilton alliance  Also  Trident will likely stay a domestic brand while EIH\\'s expansion overseas will be with the Oberoi brand  Strategic alliance for the Oberoi brand is currently not being considered  Mr Mukherji said  At a press briefing attended by Mr P R S  Oberoi  Chairman & CEO  EIH  company officials said the move is not a prelude to equity participation by Hilton at EIH  But on likely spin-off for Trident  Mr Mukherji said  that was for the future to decide  Hilton usually operates owned properties  franchisee agreements reserved for trusted partners  The alliance between EIH and Hilton International (subsidiary of Hilton Group plc and Hilton Hotels Corporation) is for an initial   years  but Mr Oberoi said  the two were \"looking forward to a much longer relationship \" Today\\'s agreement does not prevent EIH or Hilton from continuing their growth here through owned properties  \"It is possible that we will invest  but we will be wiser investors \" Mr David Michels  Group Chief Executive  Hilton Group  said  He maintained  the timing of the alliance is correct for the simple reason that hoteliering post-    has been difficult and it is a business that \"always comes back \" It will take a year or two for the alliance to show result  but as business improves the Trident-Hilton alliance is expected to fetch properties here higher occupancy levels and better match between rack rates (published tariff) and actual rates  Key ingredients would be Hilton\\'s reservation system and clientele abroad  including its loyalty programme that boasts of eight million regular customers  Mr Michels said  the foreign major is also interested in growing outbound travel from India  prospective business for Hilton properties elsewhere in the world  HIMALYA

inexpensive  small cars with Bajaj Auto Co  “There would not be any overlapping with other agreements in India ” said Carlos Ghosn  president and chief executive officer of Nissan  who is also the CEO of Renault  The Leyland venture will focus on trucks and will make some products that compete directly with Tata Motor Co ’s Ace  which is a market leader in the sub-one-tonne segment  The JV will make trucks in the range of    -  tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW)  At the lower end of the lower range  a GVW of     would mean a payload (goods carrying) capacity of     tonnes  This category has

director of Ashok Leyland  The products sporting the Leyland tag will be priced lower than those that sport the Nissan one  Though there will be two different brand names  Seshasayee added that given the equity shareholding between Ashok Leyland and Nissan  the returns to both firms would be same  The Indian CV industry has seen sales slowing in the first six months of the current fiscal on account of higher lending rates; however  sales have grown in the sub-    tonne GVW segment and the more than    -tonne GVW one  From around    market share by volume in the truck segment in  -   the

hold a    stake in this venture  which will be called Plastic Omnium Varroc Pvt Ltd  The products planned for manufacture include bumpers  bumper modules  claddings  rocker panels  finishers  structural parts and painted body panels  Among the main clients targeted are the Bajaj Auto-Renault-Nissan alliance for the      small car  General Motors India and Volkswagen  In addition  the joint

year  It is clear that all important vendors of Renault and Nissan (like Plastic Omnium in this case) will begin relocating to India  After all  they would benefit from the comparatively lower cost
